<prologue><heading>Prologue.</heading>
To the most ardent young student of the art of music, Jacobus Frontin, Johannes Tinctoris, lowliest exponent of this same art, sends his undying friendship.  Illustrious youth, with the most praiseworthy of motives you have earnestly requested that I put something down in writing for you on the subject of the imperfections of musical notes; and I have decided that I will agree to your certainly just request straight away. Indeed I am moved to such an extent that, not only for your own outstanding talent but for all other lovers of the fine arts,  if they require something from me of my opinions on that subject, then I should not delay in producing it. Nor, I pray, should you believe that this is a topic of trivial enquiry for me, since I have read and heard that previous generations of ours have discussed the subject too little, and our contemporaries even less. Be so kind, then, as to accept this short piece, dedicated with my very best wishes to your distinguished name; and I urge you in the strongest possible terms to study its highly useful teachings, lest (heaven forbid) you find yourself defiled by such imperfection of honour that what you have so laudably desired, you yourself shamelessly disdain.</prologue>
<book><chapter><heading>On the definition of imperfection and the quality of notes. Book I Chapter 1 [i]</heading>
As I am about to deal with this subject of the imperfections of musical notes, I thought that imperfection should first be defined. Imperfection, then, is the removal of one third part of the full, intrinsic value of a note or its constituent parts. And so that the topic might be illuminated all the more clearly, we should preface this by noting that only five notes of fixed value in music are universally to be found, which are placed in order in this most artfully constructed single line of pentameter:
<verse>Maxima {example}, longa {example}, breve {example}, semibreve {example}, minim {example}.</verse>
Of these five notes, some are larger, others smaller. The larger notes are those that are positioned above the lower ones; the smaller notes are those that are positioned below the upper ones. Moreover, certain notes are in different respects both larger and smaller, since they are positioned both above and below certain others. Hence we find that the maxima is only a larger note, because all the rest stand below it. The longa is a smaller note with respect to the maxima, since the former stands below the latter; but with respect to the rest, that is the breve, semibreve and minim, it is a larger note, because it stands above these. The breve is a smaller note with respect to the maxima and longa, since it stands below these latter; but with respect to the semibreve and minim it is a larger note, because it stands above these. The semibreve is a smaller note with respect to the maxima, longa and breve, since it stands below these latter; but with respect to the minim it is a larger note, because it stands above this note. The minim is only a smaller note, since the rest stand above it. And so we can conclude that the maxima is a larger note relative to the longa, breve, semibreve and minim; the longa is a smaller note relative to the maxima, but a larger note relative to the breve, semibreve and minim; the breve is a smaller note relative to the maxima and longa, but a larger note relative to the semibreve and minim; the semibreve is a smaller note relative to the maxima, longa and breve, but a larger note relative to the minim; the minim is a smaller note relative to the maxima, longa, breve and semibreve.
Hence, smaller notes form constituent parts of larger ones; and of these parts, some are neighbouring, others at one remove, others at two removes, and others at three removes. Neighbouring parts are those where between them and the notes of which they form such parts there is no larger part intervening. Thus longs are neighbouring parts of the maxima, breves of the longa, semibreves of the breve, and minims of the semibreve. Parts at one remove are those where between them and the notes of which they form such parts only one larger part is to be found. Thus breves are parts at one remove of the maxima, semibreves of the longa, and minims of the breve. Parts at two removes are those where between them and the notes of which they form such parts two larger parts are to be found. Thus semibreves are parts at two removes of the maxima, and minims of the longa. Parts at three removes are those where between them and the notes of which they form such parts all the other larger parts are to be found. Thus minims alone are parts at three removes of the maxima. From these details we should gather that of the maxima the neighbouring parts are longs, the parts at one remove are breves, the parts at two removes are semibreves, and the parts at three removes are minims. Of the longa the neighbouring parts are breves, the parts at one remove are semibreves, and the parts at two removes are minims. Of the breve the neighbouring parts are semibreves, and the parts at one remove are minims. Again, of the semibreve the neighbouring parts are minims.
And so, there is just one note that forms only a whole, that is the maxima; three notes that form both a whole and a constituent part, that is the longa, the breve, and the semibreve; and just one note that forms only a constituent part, that is the minim. Moreover, of these five notes three both imperfect and are imperfected in relation to the quality of prolation, tempus, and both kinds of modus, that is to say the longa, the breve, and the semibreve; only one note is imperfected but does not imperfect, that is to say the maxima; and only one note imperfects but is not imperfected, that is to say the minim. For smaller notes imperfect larger notes, with the result that larger notes are imperfected by smaller notes. Hence it is that the longa imperfects the maxima, and is imperfected by the breve, the semibreve, and the minim. The breve imperfects the maxima and the longa, and is imperfected by the semibreve and the minim. The semibreve imperfects the maxima, the longa, and the breve, and is imperfected by the minim. The maxima is imperfected by the longa, the breve, the semibreve, and the minim, and, because it does not have any larger note, it imperfects none. The minim, on the other hand, imperfects the maxima, the longa, the breve, and the semibreve, and because it does not have any smaller note, it is imperfected by none, as is shown in the present example:
{example}</chapter>
<chapter><heading>On the imperfection of rests. Chapter 2 [ii]</heading>
And since there are four of these five notes to each of which one individual rest specially belongs, of the same value as that of its own note, that is to say the longa {example}, the breve {example}, the semibreve {example}, and the minim {example}, one must be aware that all rests can imperfect, but cannot be imperfected, as is shown here:
{example}
Hence, whatever number and type of notes a longa, a breve, a semibreve, and a minim can imperfect, so their rests can do likewise in both number and type. And thus a longa rest will be able to imperfect a maxima; a breve rest a maxima and longa; a semibreve rest a maxima, longa, and breve; a minim rest a maxima, longa, breve, and semibreve, as is shown here:
{example}</chapter>
<chapter><heading>On the thirteen general rules of imperfection. Chapter 3 [iii]</heading>
First, therefore, dealing in general terms with this topic of imperfection in musical notes, I intend to set out thirteen general rules.
<subheading>First general rule</subheading>
The first general rule is that imperfection can occur in four ways: first, with respect to the whole only; second, with respect to all or some constituent parts, or any one part only; third, with respect to the whole and some constituent parts, or any one part only; fourth, with respect to the whole and all constituent parts at once, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>Second general rule</subheading>
The second general rule is that when a note is imperfected with respect to the whole, this is done by its neighbouring part; and when it is imperfected with respect to its parts, wither this is with respect to its neighbouring parts, and in that case it is done by its parts at one remove; or else it is with respect to its parts at one remove, and in that case it is done by its parts at two removes; or else it is with respect to its parts at two removes, and in that case it is done by its parts at three removes, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>Third general rule</subheading>
The third general rule is that it makes no difference whether a note is imperfected by a part either as a single unit or as separate elements, or else by a number of parts brought together either as a single unit or as separate elements, as is shown here:
{example}
So that this may be understood more clearly, it should be noted that a certain note may imperfect as a part functioning in a single unit, as here:
{example}
Certain notes imperfect as a part in separate elements, as here:
{example}
A certain note may imperfect as a number of parts brought together into a single unit, as here:
{example}
And certain notes imperfect as a number of parts in separate elements, as here:
{example}
<subheading>Fourth general rule</subheading>
The fourth general rule is that to imperfect is the particular characteristic of a smaller note, but to be imperfected is the particular characteristic of a larger note, since neither a larger note can imperfect a smaller note, nor can a note imperfect one of like value to itself. Hence it follows that neither will a smaller note be able to be imperfected by a larger note, nor will any note be able to be imperfected by one of like value to itself, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>Fifth general rule</subheading>
The fifth general rule is that every note which is imperfected from in front is necessarily imperfected before a larger or smaller note, because like before like cannot be imperfected, as is shown here:
{example}
As a result of this same rule it should be noted that no note will be able to be imperfected before a rest of its own value, just as before a note of like value, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>Sixth general rule</subheading>
The sixth general rule is that no note can be imperfected with respect to the whole unless it is intrinsically perfect. Similarly, with respect to constituent parts, no note will be able to be imperfected unless those particular parts are intrinsically perfect, since otherwise a one-third part would not be found which is subtracted through imperfection from the whole or the constituent part, as here:
{example}
<subheading>Seventh general rule</subheading>
The seventh general rule is that however many times a note can be divided into three equal parts, the same number of times it can be imperfected; and so it will arrive at its smallest value. For example, the longa in perfect minor modus, perfect tempus and major prolation is worth 27 minims, and these 27 make up a number divisible into three equal parts, that is into 3 times 9. Let one third part of this be taken away, and there will remain 18. But 18 can once again be divided into three equal parts, that is into 3 times 6; if a one-third part of this is taken away, that is 6, 12 will remain. And these 12 also make up a number divisible into three parts, that is into 3 times 4; let a one-third part of this be taken away, that is 4, and 8 will remain. But 8 cannot be divided into three equal parts. Hence this longa will remain standing at this value, which is its smallest, that is to say 8 minims, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>Eighth general rule</subheading>
The eighth general rule is that a note which imperfects can be placed before or after, according to the wishes of the composer. If this note is placed before, the note which is imperfected is said to be imperfected 'from in front', and if it is placed after, the note which is imperfected is said to be imperfected 'from behind', as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>Ninth general rule</subheading>
The ninth general rule is that if a single smaller note is found before a larger note which is imperfectible by it, provided that the correct quantities have been completed or that there are no other notes preceding, then it imperfects that larger note, as here:
{example}
But if, on the other hand, a smaller note is found after a larger note which is imperfectible by it, whether or not there follows another larger note which is also imperfectible by it, then it imperfects that preceding larger note, as is shown here:
{example}
Equally, if several smaller notes are found set up in imperfect number before a larger note which is imperfectible by them, provided that the correct quantities have been completed or that there are no other notes preceding, then they imperfect that larger note in whatever number they are, or are able to do so. And if there are still any remaining, also imperfect in number, then these will carry over to the next closest  location that they will be able to occupy, as is shown here:
{example}
If, on the other hand, several smaller notes are found set up in imperfect number after a larger note which is imperfectible by them, whether or not there follows another larger note which is also imperfectible by them, then they imperfect that preceding larger note in whatever number they are, or are able to do so, or in whatever number removes the imperfection in quantity. And if any are still remaining imperfect in number, then these will carry over to the next closest location which they will be able to occupy, as is shown here:
{example}
This rule, however, as given above, allows of an exception in the case of three signs, that is to say the dot of separation, the filling-in of notes, and the ligature: for if a dot of separation is attached to a group of smaller notes which otherwise, according to the above rule, would imperfect some larger note, then they will not imperfect it, but rather they will carry over to the next closest location which they will be able to occupy, as here:
{example}
And if smaller notes which otherwise, according to the above rule, would imperfect some larger note are filled in, then they will not imperfect this larger note, but rather they will be cross-grouped with other notes similarly filled in, as is shown here:
{example}
On the other hand, if smaller notes which, following this same rule, would otherwise imperfect some preceding larger note are ligated with another larger or like-value note following, which along with the smaller notes cannot imperfect that preceding larger note, then they do not imperfect it, but rather are counted together with these following notes, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>Tenth general rule</subheading>
The tenth general rule is that if one single, or several smaller notes are found set up in imperfect number either before or after a larger note which cannot be imperfected by them for instance if this larger note is itself before a note of like value or its rest, or if it has a dot of perfection attached, or if it has already been imperfected by other notes as far as possible then these smaller notes carry over to the next closest location which they can occupy, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>Eleventh general rule</subheading>
The eleventh general rule is that if a dot of separation is attached to some note on behalf of that note only, before a note of like or smaller value, then the former note will imperfect the first larger note that it can, unless it has partner notes before it, as is shown here:
{example}
If, on the other hand, a dot of separation is attached to some note, before a note of smaller or like value, on behalf not only of that note but of others, then that note, counted along with these others, will also imperfect the first larger note that it can, provided likewise that they do not have any partner notes before the note to which the dot is attached, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>Twelfth general rule</subheading>
The twelfth general rule is that a note to which a dot of separation is attached can be imperfected, as is shown here:
{example}
On the other hand, a note to which a dot of perfection or augmentation is attached is never imperfected. And the reason for this is as follows: perfection and imperfection are opposites; but opposites cannot exist simultaneously in the same subject; and so it is impossible for one and the same note to be simultaneously perfect and imperfect, as here:
{example}
By the same reasoning, since according to arithmetic, and music which is subordinate to it, addition and subtraction are opposites, and since, moreover, augmentation is a kind of addition and imperfection a kind of subtraction, it is impossible for one and the same note to be simultaneously augmented and imperfected, as is shown here:
{example}
Perhaps some people will say that Tinctoris is presuming too much, in asserting that an augmented note cannot be imperfected, since De Domarto, in the tenor of his Patrem in the irregular fifth tonem and Barbingant in the tenor of his song L'omme bany, have done the opposite, as is shown here:
{example}
To such people I would reply that, although Busnoys and a number of others have imitated these composers, I do not presume to censure anyone on the basis, as it were, of envying a person's reputation, but rather to demonstrate that they have erred by holding to our friend Truth to the best of my ability. I also name those at fault, lest our youngsters, deceived by false opinion because of the undying fame that the former have  created for themselves through their most beautiful composition, imitate them in this  respect, thinking that everything they accomplish is perfect, which is far from being the case. For, as the wise put it, nothing is perfect in all respects.
<subheading>Thirteenth general rule</subheading>
The thirteenth general rule is that any note which can be both imperfected and altered, such as the longa, breve and semibreve, if it is altered, will be able to be imperfected only with respect to some of its parts, that is to say only so many parts that the smaller notes imperfecting the larger note do not reach the intrinsic value of the latter, as is also demonstrated in this example:
{example}</chapter></book>
<book><chapter><heading>On the imperfection of musical notes on an individual basis. Book II Chapter 1 [i]</heading>
Now that we have dealt in general terms with the imperfection of musical notes, it is fitting that we deal in due order with the imperfection of each note on an  individual basis. First, then, let us begin with the maxima, which is the foremost and chief of all the other notes, so that we may thus proceed from greater to smaller.
<heading>On the imperfection of the maxima in perfect major modus. Chapter 2 [ii]</heading>
The maxima in perfect major modus can be imperfected with respect to the whole, for in this case it is worth three longs of which one, being a one-third part of that maxima, will be able to be taken away, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>On the imperfection of the maxima in perfect minor modus</subheading>
Furthermore, the maxima in perfect minor modus can be imperfected with respect to two neighbouring parts, or one only, because in this case the longa, which is its neighbouring part, is worth three breves. Hence for each longa one breve, being a one-third part of the former, will be able to be taken away, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>On the imperfection of the maxima in perfect tempus</subheading>
Furthermore, the maxima in perfect tempus can be imperfected with respect to five, four, three or two parts at one remove, or one only, for in this case the breve, which is its part at one remove, is worth three semibreves. Hence for each breve one semibreve, being a one-third part of the former, will be able to be taken away, as here:
{example}
<subheading>On the imperfection of the maxima in major prolation</subheading>
Furthermore, the maxima in major prolation can be imperfected with respect to eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three or two parts at two removes, or one only, because in this case the semibreve, which is its part at two removes, is worth three minims. Hence for each semibreve one minim, being a one-third part of the former, will be able to be taken away, as is shown here:
{example}</chapter>
<chapter><heading>On the fifteen methods of imperfecting the maxima. Chapter 3 [iii]</heading>
And since in numerous pieces of music all the mensural quantities are perfect, and in other pieces one or more perfect quantities are mixed throughout with one or more imperfect, the result is that there are fifteen methods by which the maxima can be imperfected.
<subheading>The first method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The first method is with respect only to the whole; and this occurs in perfect major modus, imperfect minor modus, imperfect tempus and minor prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The second method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The second method is with respect only to the neighbouring parts; and this occurs in imperfect major modus, perfect minor modus, imperfect tempus and minor prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The third method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The third method is with respect only to the parts at one remove; and this occurs in imperfect modus of both kinds, perfect tempus and minor prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The fourth method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The fourth method is with respect only to the parts at two removes; and this occurs in imperfect modus of both kinds, imperfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The fifth method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The fifth method is with respect only to the whole and the neighbouring parts; and this occurs in perfect modus of both kinds, imperfect tempus and minor prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The sixth method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The sixth method is with respect only to the whole and the parts at one remove; and this occurs in perfect major modus, imperfect minor modus, perfect tempus and minor prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The seventh method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The seventh method is with respect only to the whole and the parts at two removes; and this occurs in perfect major modus, imperfect minor modus, imperfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The eighth method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The eighth method is with respect only to the whole, the neighbouring parts, and the parts at one remove; and this occurs in perfect modus of both kinds, perfect tempus and minor prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The ninth method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The ninth method is with respect only to the whole, the neighbouring parts, and the parts at two removes; and this occurs in perfect modus of both kinds, imperfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The tenth method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The tenth method is with respect only to the whole, the parts at one remove, and the parts at two removes; and this occurs in perfect major modus, imperfect minor modus, perfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The eleventh method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The eleventh method is with respect only to the neighbouring parts and the parts at one remove; and this occurs in imperfect major modus, perfect minor modus, perfect tempus and minor prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The twelfth method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The twelfth method is with respect only to the neighbouring parts and the parts at two removes; and this occurs in imperfect major modus, perfect minor modus, imperfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The thirteenth method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The thirteenth method is with respect only to the parts at one remove and the parts at two removes; and this occurs in imperfect modus of both kinds, perfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The fourteenth method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The fourteenth method is with respect only to the neighbouring parts, the parts at one remove, and the parts at two removes; and this occurs in imperfect major modus, perfect minor modus, perfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The fifteenth method of imperfecting the maxima</subheading>
The fifteenth method is with respect to the whole, the neighbouring parts, the parts at one remove, and the parts at two removes all at the same time; and this occurs in perfect modus of both kinds, perfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}</chapter>
<chapter><heading>On the imperfection of the longa in perfect minor modus. Chapter 4 [iv]</heading>
The longa in perfect minor modus can be imperfected with respect to the whole, for in this case it is worth three breves, of which one, being a one-third part of that longa, will be able to be taken away, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>On the imperfection of the longa in perfect tempus</subheading>
Furthermore, the longa in perfect tempus can be imperfected with respect to two neighbouring parts, or one only, because in this case the breve, which is its neighbouring part, is worth three semibreves. Hence for each breve one semibreve, being a one-third part of the former, will be able to be taken away, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>On the imperfection of the longa in major prolation</subheading>
Furthermore, the longa in major prolation can be imperfected with respect to five, four, three or two parts at one remove, or one only, for in this case the semibreve, which is its part at one remove, is worth three minims. Hence for each semibreve one minim, being a one-third part of the former, will be able to be taken away, as is shown here:
{example}</chapter>
<chapter><heading>On the seven methods of imperfecting the longa. Chapter 5 [v]</heading>
And since in numerous pieces of music, under major modus of either kind, perfect mensural quantities of minor modus, tempus and prolation are set up, and in other pieces one or more perfect quantities are mixed throughout with one or more imperfect, the result is that there are seven methods by which the longa can be imperfected.
<subheading>The first method of imperfecting the longa</subheading>
The first method is with respect only to the whole; and this occurs in major modus of either kind, perfect minor modus, imperfect tempus and minor prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The second method of imperfecting the longa</subheading>
The second method is with respect only to the neighbouring parts; and this occurs in major modus of either kind, imperfect minor modus, perfect tempus and minor prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The third method of imperfecting the longa</subheading>
The third method is with respect only to the parts at one remove; and this occurs in major modus of either kind, imperfect minor modus, imperfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The fourth method of imperfecting the longa</subheading>
The fourth method is with respect only to the whole and the neighbouring parts; and this occurs in major modus of either kind, perfect minor modus, perfect tempus and minor prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The fifth method of imperfecting the longa</subheading>
The fifth method is with respect only to the whole and the parts at one remove; and this occurs in major modus of either kind, perfect minor modus, imperfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The sixth method of imperfecting the longa</subheading>
The sixth method is with respect only to the neighbouring parts and the parts at one remove; and this occurs in major modus of either kind, imperfect minor modus, perfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The seventh method of imperfecting the longa</subheading>
The seventh method is with respect to the whole, the neighbouring parts, and the parts at one remove all at the same time; and this occurs in major modus of either kind, perfect minor modus, perfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}</chapter>
<chapter><heading>On the imperfection of the breve in perfect tempus. Chapter 6 [vi]</heading>
The breve in perfect tempus can be imperfected with respect to the whole, because in this case it is worth three semibreves, of which one, being a one-third part of that breve, will be able to be taken away, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>On the imperfection of the breve in major prolation</subheading>
Furthermore, the breve in major prolation can be imperfected with respect to two neighbouring parts, or one only, for in this case the semibreve, which is its neighbouring part, is worth three minims. Hence for each semibreve one minim, being a one-third part of the former, will be able to be taken away, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>On the three methods of imperfecting the breve</subheading>
And since in numerous pieces of music, under major or minor modus of either kind, perfect tempus and major prolation occur together, and in other pieces imperfect tempus with major prolation, or the reverse, perfect tempus with minor prolation, are mixed together, the result is that there are three methods by which the breve can be imperfected.
<subheading>The first method of imperfecting the breve</subheading>
The first method is with respect only to the whole; and this occurs in major or minor modus of either kind, perfect tempus and minor prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The second method of imperfecting the breve</subheading>
The second method is with respect only to the neighbouring parts; and this occurs in major or minor modus of either kind, imperfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>The third method of imperfecting the breve</subheading>
The third method is with respect to the whole and the neighbouring parts at the same time; and this occurs in major or minor modus of either kind, perfect tempus and major prolation, as is shown here:
{example}</chapter>
<chapter><heading>On the single method of imperfecting the semibreve. Chapter 7 [vii]</heading>
The semibreve can be imperfected by just one method, which is to say with respect only to the whole; and this occurs in major prolation under any kind of modus and tempus, because in this case it is worth three minims, of which one, being a one-third part of that semibreve, will be able to be taken away, as is shown here:
{example}</chapter>
<chapter><heading>On the three signs of imperfection. Chapter 8 [viii]</heading>
Finally, because there are certain fixed signs by which notes are recognized as being imperfected, I consider it necessary to say a few words about these. And so, it should be known that there are three signs which indicate that an imperfectible note is imperfected, which is to say imperfection by number, filling-in of the note, and separation by dot.
<subheading>On the first sign of imperfection</subheading>
As regards the first: whenever smaller notes are found set up in imperfect number either before or after a larger note, it is a sign that the first larger note which is imperfectible by them is to be imperfected, unless the smaller notes are to be cross-grouped beforehand with partner-notes, as is shown here:
{example}
<subheading>On the second sign of imperfection</subheading>
As regards the second: whenever a whole note is filled in, it is a sign that it is imperfected by a one-third part of its full value; and if only a half of the note is filled in, it is a sign that it has been imperfected by a one-third part of half of its value. Also, smaller notes which in this way imperfect larger notes should be filled in just as the latter are; nor does it matter whether the smaller notes precede or follow the larger, or whether the former and latter are immediately juxtaposed or placed with other notes in between, as is shown here:
{example}
If, however, three like notes have been filled in to indicate imperfection, whether they are placed immediately after one another or not, then the middle note imperfects the first from behind, and the last from in front, as neighbouring parts brought together in a single unit, as is shown here:
{example}
And since the filling-in of notes indicates not only imperfection, but also cross-grouping, sesquialtera and dupla proportion, I have comprehensively explained in my Proportionale Musices how to identify readily which of these four indications should be adopted, whenever such filling-in of notes is encountered in some piece of music. For this reason I am not saying anything on the subject in the present treatise.
<subheading>On the third sign of imperfection</subheading>
As regards the third: whenever a dot of separation is added to any note on behalf of that note only, or on behalf of both it and other notes, it is a sign that the first larger note which is imperfectible by them is to be imperfected, unless the smaller notes are to be cross-grouped beforehand with partner-notes, as is shown here:
{example}</chapter></book>
<conclusion><heading>The conclusion of this work</heading>
And this should be enough said on the imperfection of musical notes. If anything therein is found to have been set down imperfectly, I pray that all those perfected in this divine art may be willing to perfect it as with a more perfect love, so that God, the great Lord of all knowledge, who knows no need of imperfection, may deem them worthy to be rewarded with his most perfect blessing.</conclusion>
