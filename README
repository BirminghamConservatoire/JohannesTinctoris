Project files for a digital edition of the Complete Theoretical Works of Johannes Tinctoris

There are two modules included:
  * JT-editor: an online form and renderer for editors to input mixed music and text (and work-input for music only)
  * JohannesTinctoris: a draft version of the website to be mounted

Both modules are in the early alpha stages of development, and consist
of messy research code. Please contact project members for more information.

N.B. Setup will require users to install JQuery and JQuery UI in
appropriate places. This will be documented properly at some point.
