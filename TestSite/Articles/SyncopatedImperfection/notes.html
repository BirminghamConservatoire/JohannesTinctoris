<title>Ronald Woodley 'Syncopated Imperfection and Alteration' Notes</title>
</head>

<body>
<p><a name="1" id="1"></a>The standard printed edition currently available is  <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#tinctoris1975">Tinctoris 1975</a>: the <em>Liber imperfectionum notarum musicalium</em> is at i. 143–67; the <em>Tractatus alterationum</em> at i. 173–9; the <em>Scriptum … super punctis musicalibus</em> at i. 185–98. New  texts and translations of these treatises are, or will shortly become, available online as part of the present Tinctoris project.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="2" id="2"></a>One qualification to this statement of which I am aware is the French translation in manuscript of the bulk of Tinctoris&rsquo;s theoretical writings, drafted by François-Joseph Fétis in the mid-nineteenth century from the primary Brussels source (Bibliothèque royale, MS II 4147) while Fétis owned this manuscript: see <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2011">Woodley 2011</a>: 138. Fétis&rsquo;s translation, which includes some commentary notes, survives as Brussels, Bibliothèque royale, MS 5482–3, but it has not yet been studied at all.<br />

</p>
<p><a name="{04}" id="{04}"></a>Throughout this essay I use the medieval -<em>e</em> form, rather than the classical or neo-classical –<em>æ</em> diphthong/ligature, except where quoting directly from a source which employs the latter.<br />
</p>
<p><a name="{05}" id="{05}"></a>A notable exception to this is <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#blackburn1981">Blackburn 1981</a>: esp. 68–71.<br />
  </p>
<p><a name="{06}" id="{06}"></a>It is worth mentioning here that the present essay does not attempt to discuss non-standard usages by, for instance, Machaut, who occasionally adapts the strict principle of imperfection to include notes which are not themselves <em>partes propinque</em> of perfect entities, such as minims in minor prolation, as agents of imperfection: see, for instance, <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#apel1953">Apel 1953</a>: 112 and commentary ibid., 440. This adaptation of the system on Machaut&rsquo;s part is cited by a number of theorists in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, following De Muris&rsquo;s basic precepts but categorizing Machaut&rsquo;s usage as erroneous; and it is clear that even at the end of the fifteenth century Gafori, for example, was aware of this theoretical tradition: see <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#gaforus1496">Gaforus 1496</a>: fol. bb iiij (Book 2, Chapter 11); also briefly discussed in <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#gaforus1969">Gaforus 1969</a>: 98–9. Young also mentions Gafori&rsquo;s citation of Machaut&rsquo;s usage in his own hand-written version of the De Muris &lsquo;<em>Practica musice</em>&rsquo;, following his <em>Glossemata super nonnullis partibus prime partis theorice musice Ioannis de muris</em>, surviving as Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, MS H165 <em>inf</em>., fols. 18v–22, at fol. 19v. I am most grateful to Bonnie J. Blackburn for enabling me to consult a microfilm of this work. See also, most recently, <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#lerchkalavrytinos2007">Lerch-Kalavrytinos 2007</a>: 241. I am also grateful to Margaret Bent for pointing out to me that the English composer Leonel practises this extended use of the &lsquo;imperfection&rsquo; of already imperfect values at the beginning of the five-voice Amen sections of his Glora and Credo settings surviving as Nos. 21 and 77 of the Old Hall manuscript; in both of these cases Leonel imperfects an already fully imperfect maxima with a single minim. <br />
</p>
<p><a name="{07}" id="{07}"></a>In addition to the use of the term in various of his mensural treatises, Tinctoris defines <em>reductio</em> in his <em>Diffinitorium</em> as &lsquo;unius aut plurium notarum cum maioribus quas imperficiunt aut cum sociis annumeratio&rsquo; (&lsquo;the reckoning together of one or more notes with larger notes which they imperfect, or with [other] partner notes.&rsquo; (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#tinctoris2004">Tinctoris 2004</a>: 40). On the use of the term [<em>nota</em>]<em> socia</em>, see below in the present essay.<br />

<p><a name="{08}" id="{08}"></a>See <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#tinctoris1975">Tinctoris 1975</a>: i. 187; as printed as Ex. 4 of Seay's edition, however, many of the dots are actually misplaced.            <br />

<p><a name="{09}" id="{09}"></a>See {17} below.<br />
  </p>
<p><a name="{10}" id="{10}"></a>The reference to duple proportion here refers primarily to Tinctoris&rsquo;s assertion, especially in his <em>Proportionale</em> but also the <em>Tractatus de notis et pausis</em>, that (within a void base notation) black &lsquo;semiminims&rsquo; are actually minims coloured under <em>proportio dupla</em>. For the relevant passages of the <em>Proportionale</em>, see <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#tinctoris2008">Tinctoris 2008</a>: 36–48; <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#tinctoris1975">Tinctoris 1975</a>: iib. 17 and 19–25.<br />

</p>
<p><a name="{12}" id="{12}"></a>For a brief recent discussion, however, of the unusual use in late fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century English sources of the <em>cauda hirundinis</em> (swallow&rsquo;s tail) to indicate non-standard quasi-alteration, sometimes incorporating displacement and even indicating &lsquo;alteration&rsquo; of the first, rather than second, of the two notes, see <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#lefferts2007">Lefferts 2007</a>: 274–5; also <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#bentforthcoming">Bent forthcoming</a>.<br />

  </p>
<p><a name="{14}" id="{14}"></a>The best manuscript sources of this treatise (Brussels 4147, Valencia 835 and Bologna 2573) unanimously read &lsquo;Quiquidem puncti vulgariter dicuntur asinei …&rsquo; in the relevant passage, leading to the slightly unusual form <em>punctus asineus</em>, while Ghent 70, fol. 176 reads &lsquo;puncti … azinini&rsquo;, from the more classical adjective <em>asininus</em>.<br />
  </p>
<p><a name="{15}" id="{15}"></a>In his letter Del Lago also explains Tinctoris&rsquo;s notion of <em>reductio</em>, as discussed in the present essay. <br />
  </p>
<p><a name="{16}" id="{16}"></a>Elsewhere in the <em>Liber imperfectionum</em> Tinctoris does indulge in his characteristic <em>ad hominem</em> criticisms of contemporary composers, including De Domarto, Barbingant and Busnoys (see text of present project, esp. I.iii towards the end of the Twelfth General Rule; <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#tinctoris1975">Tinctoris 1975</a>: i. 153–4), though these examples do not specifically impinge on the discussions here. For a preliminary paper on the wider, more critically orientated issues of textuality and <em>auctoritas</em> which emerge from such citations, see <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2005">Woodley 2005</a>.  </p>
<p><a name="{17}" id="{17}"></a>Tinctoris&rsquo;s scheme of things seems not to extend explicitly to using coloration by itself to indicate <em>note socie</em> for purposes of alteration, though we have already seen how he accepts coloration as a valid means of indicating the correct <em>reductio</em> of displaced imperfection groupings. In one example of the <em>Tractatus alterationum</em>, however, Tinctoris uses the coloration of a syncopated pairing of blackened (but still perfect) breve plus (imperfected) long in order to indicate a mensural grouping which prevents the expected alteration of the second of a pair of uncoloured breves which stand immediately before that long. See the legacy edition of the treatise within the present project<em></em>, Example 3, and commentary.<br />

<p><a name="{18}" id="{18}"></a>For discussions of the musical relations between England and continental Europe, at both technical and institutional levels, see for example <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#dumitrescu2006">Dumitrescu 2006</a> and  <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#dumitrescu2007">Dumitrescu 2007</a>). In the context of the longer fifteenth-century history of complex notation in England, there are also clear linkages to be explored from <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#bentforthcoming">Bent forthcoming</a>.</p>
