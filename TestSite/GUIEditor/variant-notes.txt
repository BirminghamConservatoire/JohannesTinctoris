Variants are a bit of a muddle at the moment, but here's how they work.

* areas of divergence are contained in Choice objects

* paths of divergence are contained in Readings objects with witnesses

* a path can be followed in compound objects using nextEvent(var) and prevEvent(var)

* since direction may be important (for example in oblique), there is
  a (this) type method that's directional: forwardElement. How I fill
  these slots will affect how necessary that is.
