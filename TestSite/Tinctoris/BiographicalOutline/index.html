<p><b><a name="life_earlyyears" id="life_earlyyears"></a>Early years and education</b><br />
Little can be pieced together at present of Tinctoris's first
twenty-five years or so. His initial musical education, presumably
in the 1440s and early 1450s, is likely to have been at one of the <i>ma&icirc;trises</i> close to his home town, such as Cambrai, Soignies or Nivelles,
though details are unknown. His father may be the Martin le Taintenier
recorded as municipal magistrate ('&eacute;chevin') of the small
town of Braine-l'Alleud, some twelve miles south of Brussels,
in the parish archives for 1456 (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#riddersymoens1978">Ridder-Symoens 1978</a>: 69; see also <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2007b">Woodley 2007b</a>: n. 7). In 1460 Tinctoris was paid for
four months' service 'in habitu ecclesie' at Cambrai Cathedral,
the payment being approved for disbursement from the account of
the <i>petits vicaires</i>. Although the exact nature of his service
is not entirely clear (Tinctoris is not cited in other detailed
lists as <i>petit vicaire</i> proper: <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#planchart1993"
target="frame3017787">Planchart 1993</a>: 367&ndash;8), he would certainly
have had personal contact with, and perhaps musical tuition from,
Dufay while he was there; from this early period, then, we can
date the deep-seated loyalty to Dufay and his music that we read
later in his treatises. It is partly on the basis of this Cambrai reference in 1460, seen as corroborating a later reference by Trithemius in 1495 that Tinctoris was 'about sixty', that a birth-date of <em>c</em>.&nbsp;1435 has been surmised. In view, however, both of the ambiguities surrounding these references, and other uncertainties relating to his subsequent period at Orl&eacute;ans, outlined below, we should probably allow a latitude of  around five years on either side of this date. </p>

<p>By the very early 1460s, too,  he had gained the post of succentor at the Cathedral
of Ste-Croix, Orl&eacute;ans, and by September 1462 he had matriculated
as student in the German nation at the University of Orl&eacute;ans (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1981">Woodley 1981</a>: 225&ndash;8).
Here he is already given the title 'venerabilis dominus magister', which causes some
difficulty of interpretation. Although nothing is definitely known
of any previous university studies, he may conceivably have attended
the University of Louvain in the late 1440s &ndash;
two candidates of the correct name and diocesan origin can been
identified (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1981">Woodley 1981</a>: 219) &ndash; but this would require his birth-date, again, to be pushed back to something closer to 1430, and in any case the title 'magister' may equally have been given in recognition solely
of his teaching position at Ste-Croix. A third, intriguing possibility is that he had taken his bachelor's and master's degrees
simultaneously at Orl&eacute;ans, after five years of study &ndash; an acknowledged, if not especially common, procedure at this university. Such a pathway, though,
would imply that he first matriculated <i>c</i>.&nbsp;1457, that his
entry into the German nation in 1462 represents an internal transfer
of some kind (unlikely in view of his geographical origins), and perhaps that he had taken special leave in 1460 to make
the short-term sojourn at Cambrai. It is clear that Tinctoris did indeed obtain a master's qualification in both canon and civil law, as he consistently styles himself 'in legibus licentiatus' in his treatises; it seems most likely, therefore, that this was achieved during his time at Orl&eacute;ans. Whatever the uncertainties surrounding his early university studies, by 1463 (new style) Tinctoris
had rapidly risen to the senior administrative position of <i>procurator</i>
of the German nation at Orl&eacute;ans, with responsibility for
its admissions procedure; his own entry in the matriculation book
(<i>Liber procuratorum</i>) at this time (1 April 1463 new style)
provides the earliest, and perhaps only, verifiable example of
his handwriting (<a href="../../Images/jt_orleans.png" target="_blank">image</a>: <em>opens in new window</em>). This document also crucially seals the identity of Tinctoris's home town/village as Braine-l'Alleud in the diocese of Cambrai. At some point, presumably in the later 1460s, Tinctoris was in
charge of the choirboys at Chartres Cathedral, as he recounts
himself later in his treatise <i>De inventione et usu musice</i> (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#weinmann1961">Weinmann 1961</a>: 34; <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1981">Woodley 1981</a>: 229&ndash;30).
Since, however, virtually all of the relevant records at Chartres were
destroyed during World War II, it has proved frustratingly difficult
to expand our knowledge of this important middle period of Tinctoris's
career, before he moved south to Italy.</p>

<p><b><a name="life_naples" id="life_naples"></a>Naples</b><br />
In the early 1470s (perhaps 1472 or 1473) Tinctoris travelled to Naples, to enter
the service of King Ferdinand&nbsp;I (Ferrante) as singer-chaplain,
legal adviser and court tutor in both the theory and practice
of music. (In addition to his singing abilities and theoretical
expertise, he apparently played the bowed vihuela and rebec with great enthusiasm: 'Hec itaque duo instrumenta mea sunt, mea inquam.' (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#weinmann1961">Weinmann 1961</a>: 46))
He was perhaps drawn to Naples
partly by the reputation for law of the University there, but all other details of the recruitment process or material enticements offered to Tinctoris by Ferrante have been lost. Almost all of his writings date from this time in Naples, which
lasted for around twenty years. During this period, Tinctoris's
status at court was clearly high, and on at least one occasion,
in October 1487, he was sent back to northern Europe to recruit
new singers for the Neapolitan chapel, having been given letters
of introduction from Ferrante to Charles&nbsp;VIII of France and
the Emperor Maximilian (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1981">Woodley 1981</a>: 235 and 245); he probably visited Bruges and Li&egrave;ge
on the same expedition. Tinctoris's wider legal and linguistic expertise, too, had already been called upon by Ferrante in drawing up an Italian translation of the articles and ordinances of the Order of the Golden Fleece, to which Ferrante was elected knight in May 1473 (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1988">Woodley 1988</a>). A brief trip to Ferrara in 1479 is also
recorded, where he stayed for several nights (7-11 May) at the Angel
Inn ('hosto alanzello'), at the expense of the Este court, on
business perhaps relating to the musical establishment of the
new chapel of Santa Maria di Corte (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#atlas1985"
target="frame3017787">Atlas 1985</a>: 74; <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1981">Woodley 1981</a>: 234). It is not certain
whether Tinctoris ever became <i>archicapellanus</i> or first
chaplain to Ferrante; the early biographical note (otherwise remarkably
accurate) by Abbot Johannes Trithemius (<i>Cathalogus illustrium
virorum Germaniam ... exornantium</i> [Mainz], <i>c</i>.&nbsp;1495)
states that he had risen to this rank, but there is no independent
corroboration of this. In a supplication to Pope Innocent&nbsp;VIII,
dated 24 October 1490, Tinctoris (still 'cantor capellanus') requests
that he be accorded the title and privileges of doctor of canon
and civil law, in recognition of his studies (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#sherr1994"
target="frame3017787">Sherr 1994</a>: 69&ndash;70). The supplication
was apparently successful, as Trithemius uses this title in his
entry of<em> </em>1495. During his time in Naples (on which see also <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#dagostino1999">D'Agostino 1999</a>) Tinctoris was
profoundly affected by his close contact with the highest intellectual
levels of Italian humanism, though there is evidence of some disillusionment
in his later years (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1988"
target="frame3017787">Woodley 1988</a>: 198&ndash;202).</p>

<p><b><a name="life_lastyears" id="life_lastyears"></a>Last years</b><br />
Tinctoris probably quitted, or drifted away from, his formal position
in Naples in the very early 1490s, for reasons which may be partly connected with the declining political fortunes of the Neapolitan Aragonese court and its frictions with other Italian and French ruling parties. He may well have been in Rome
in 1492 for the enthronement of Rodrigo Borgia as Pope Alexander&nbsp;VI,
in celebration of which he later wrote both the words and music
of a motet <i>Gaude Roma vetus</i>, whose text only has survived
in Johannes Burckard's <i>Liber notarum</i> (printed in <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1981"
target="frame3017787">Woodley 1981</a>: 238). There is some
very circumstantial evidence that he visited the court in Buda
around 1493, where his erstwhile pupil Beatrice of Arag&oacute;n,
by then widowed Queen of Hungary, was still resident with her
own chapel. Very little else &ndash; perhaps curiously in view of his high reputation &ndash; is known of the last twenty years
of Tinctoris's life. He had enjoyed additional income as non-resident
canon of St&nbsp;Gertrude's, Nivelles (close to his home town),
since around 1488&ndash;9 (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1981">Woodley 1981</a>: 236 and 246; and <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2007b">Woodley 2007b</a>: esp. &sect;3&ndash;5), and he must have held another benefice, of a value not exceeding 100 ducats, at the parish church of St&nbsp;George at the
Old Market ('ad mercatum veterem') in Naples, which he resigned
'apud sedem' (i.e. in person, at the Holy See) on 11&nbsp;June
1502 (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#sherr1983">Sherr
1983</a>: 9&ndash;10). There is indirect evidence from his letter
to the royal court copyist Joanmarco Cinico (see <b><a href="#anchor1525193">II.&nbsp;Writings</a></b>
below) that Tinctoris revisited the Naples area, on a philosophically
inspired sight-seeing trip, around 1495&ndash;96; the wider context of this visit, however, when he was probably already in his early sixties, is unknown. He may have returned
to his homeland in his last years &ndash; though recent research renders this much less certain (see <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2007b">Woodley 2007b</a>)
&ndash; and he died, in his seventies or early eighties, probably on 9 February 1511,
the year in which his Nivelles benefice passed to his successor
Peter de Coninck (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1981">Woodley 1981</a>: 240 and 247&ndash;8). Tinctoris's obit was commemorated on 9 February at St Gertrude's, at least from 1515&ndash;16: see <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2007b">Woodley 2007b</a> for further detail. </p>

<p>A patriotic and suitably romanticized statue to Tinctoris,
sculpted by Louis Samain, was unveiled on the Place Bl&eacute;val
in Nivelles on 17&nbsp;August 1875, and although this was destroyed
during World War II a bust copy survives  in
the foyer of the Town Hall there. A cinema and caf&eacute; on the same town square
were also named after Tinctoris, because of its proximity to the
statue. (Illustrations of these are given in the online version of <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2007">Woodley 2007a</a>, embedded in the present edition.) The closest depiction of the musician from life is that
of the illuminated frontispiece to the Valencia copy of his treatises:
for facsimile images, see  <b><a href="#anchor1526603">III.&nbsp;Principal manuscript sources:
a brief sketch</a></b> below.</p>

<h3><a name="anchor1525193" id="anchor1525193"></a>II. Writings: an overview</h3>

<p>Twelve Latin treatises by Tinctoris survive in whole or part,
which demonstrate not only the writer's command of notational
and music-theoretical principles for teaching purposes, but also
his close working knowledge of major contemporary composers such
as Dufay, Okeghem and Busnoys, as well as more minor figures such
as Regis, Caron, Faugues and De Domarto. Although he famously
acknowledges, in the <i>Proportionale</i>, his and their compositional
debt to English music, especially that of Dunstaple, a particularly
zealous enthusiasm for the French and Netherlandish music of his
own generation provides the main impetus to his writings. He is
one of the first significant theorists to make technically detailed
<i>ad hominem</i> criticisms of his contemporaries' music and
of their notational and contrapuntal idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>Tinctoris's earliest treatise, perhaps compiled before his
move to Naples, was a <i>Speculum musices</i>, which is now lost,
though its contents may have been largely revised and redistributed
throughout his surviving writings. Most of the known treatises
are undated, but were written in the first few years of his employment
at Ferrante's court. Their order of completion does not follow
expected pedagogical progression, but their disposition in the
principal manuscripts seems designed in part to rectify this.
The <i>Expositio manus</i> (<i>c</i>.&nbsp;1472&ndash;73), dedicated to Johannes
de Lotinis, explains the fundamentals of solmization, hexachords
and mutation in relation to the Guidonian hand; the work's dedicatee
is later cited in <i>De inventione et usu musice</i> as one of
the finest soprano singers known to Tinctoris, and from Dinant,
close to the author's home town. The <i>Proportionale musices</i>
may have been the next to be completed; it is one of the most
comprehensive treatments of mensuration and proportion from the
period, showing a broad-based awareness of contemporary practices
and malpractices. It must be admitted, though, that the text is also frustrating in its omission of some
more basic guidance on, for instance, the author's understanding of the meaning of certain mensuration signs. Many of its specially composed musical
examples (other than those extracted from the work of other composers)
seem to give some indication &ndash; albeit schematic &ndash; of how rhythmically elaborate extemporization
(vocal as well as instrumental) may have been practised. The work's
dedicatory prologue to Ferrante is modelled partly on Cicero (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1987">Woodley
1987</a>; <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#wegman2003">Wegman 2003</a>), and provides a good demonstration of Tinctoris's
newly acquired humanistic latinity. The <i>Liber imperfectionum notarum musicalium </i>
(before 1475) gives clear guidance on the imperfection of note-values, taken to a remarkably sophisticated level of complexity (see <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2006c">Woodley 2006c</a>),
and is dedicated to a young, promising musician, Jacobus Frontin,
who may be the 'Jacotino Frontin cantore' cited in a letter of
5&nbsp;April 1516 from Enea Pio to Cardinal Ippolito&nbsp;II d'Este
as having recently taken up the post of chapel-master to Francis&nbsp;I.
Since the treatise was ostensibly the direct result of a request
from Frontin, he may have been a young singer in the Neapolitan
chapel at the time, though there is no corroborating evidence for this. The <i>Tractatus de regulari valore notarum</i>
(before 1475) followed soon afterwards, dedicated to Princess
Beatrice some time before her betrothal to Mathias Corvinus of
Hungary. The work provides a basic treatment of note-values and
the various mensural permutations of modus, tempus and prolatio,
in the course of which Tinctoris affirms the invariability of
the minim. The <i>Tractatus de notis et pausis</i> sets out more
essential information on note-values, the interpretation of ligature
configurations, and rests, including a brief chapter on notes
of 'unfixed value' in plainsong. This treatise is dedicated to
another singer, Martin Hanard, described as 'canon of Cambrai'
and 'apostolic singer', i.e. member of the pope's private chapel.
Probably also dating from this same period are the brief <i>Tractatus
alterationum</i> and the <i>Scriptum&nbsp;...&nbsp;super punctis
musicalibus</i>. The former, a series of general rules on the
application of alteration to note-values (and, as with the <em>Liber imperfectionum</em>, remarkably sophisticated in its technical detail: see <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2006c">Woodley 2006c</a>), has a particularly perplexing
dedication to 'Guillelmus Guinandi'; from Tinctoris's description,
this seems to be an error for the abbot Antonio Guinati, first
chaplain to the Duke of Milan, though the cause of the misattribution
is difficult to determine. The <i>Scriptum&nbsp;...&nbsp;super
punctis</i>, lacking any dedication, provides a valuable guide
to the various types of dot, or point, used in mensural notation.
The writer distinguishes the dots of division, augmentation, perfection,
prolation, repetition, and the 'punctus acceptionis', equivalent
in many cases to what we usually term the <i>signum congruentiae</i>;
in these guidelines a number of subtle distinctions of usage,
positioning and interpretation are made which exceed the treatment
of many more modern textbooks on notation.</p>

<p>Two substantial pedagogic treatises were written a little after
the first, pre-1475 wave of writings. The <i>Liber de natura et
proprietate tonorum</i>, whose completion date is given uniquely
in the main Brussels manuscript as 6&nbsp;November 1476, is a
thorough and clear exposition of the modal system, including treatment
of mixture and commixture, the categories of perfect, imperfect
and 'pluperfect' ('plusquam perfectus') mode, and irregular finals.
A brief chapter acknowledges the problems of trying to apply the
modal system to polyphony; although Tinctoris wrestles to provide
some guidelines here, these are not wholly satisfactory. The dedication
jointly to Okeghem and Busnoys ostensibly results from the disquiet
caused to some musicians by Tinctoris's attacks on these composers
in his <i>Proportionale</i>; the author is careful, however, not
to cede any intellectual ground over his criticisms. The most
extensive of the surviving treatises is the <i>Liber de arte contrapuncti</i>,
in three books, dated (again uniquely in the Brussels manuscript)
11&nbsp;October 1477. This work provides Tinctoris's main exposition
of intervals, consonance and dissonance, and methods of handling
these in both simple, note-against-note counterpoint and more
elaborate figuration. Interesting (and still debated) distinctions
are also made between what Tinctoris considers appropriate to
fully worked-out, notated counterpoint and (quasi-)extemporized
<i>super librum</i> performance, and towards the end of the treatise
Tinctoris gives his views on the acceptable pacing of dissonance
in mensural music, and on the different parameters of <i>varietas</i>
involved in good composition. Like the <i>Proportionale</i>, the
work is dedicated to his employer, Ferrante, and as with the earlier
treatise its prologue is self-consciously literary, though it
also provides valuable comments on Tinctoris's (characteristically
empirical) disbelief in the harmony of the spheres, his absolute
commitment to the music of his own time, and an acknowledgement
that he uses the best work of his contemporaries as direct stylistic
models for his own composition.</p>

<p>Only two treatises were printed during Tinctoris's lifetime.
The <i>Terminorum musicae diffinitorium</i>, or glossary of musical
terms, was originally compiled before 1475, and dedicated to Princess
Beatrice, at the time under Tinctoris's musical tutelage. (A recent new edition, with Italian translation, is now available as <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#panti2004">Panti 2004</a>.) As an
early example of the genre it holds some considerable interest,
though most of its 300-odd entries are of rather limited usefulness
today: by and large the work provides a synoptic handbook of material
covered in more detail in the other writings, though there are
certainly a few items whose wording suggests ways in which the
author's thought evolved and was modified during his professional
life. The glossary was printed, with a small number of revisions,
by Tinctoris's compatriot and fellow musician Gerardus of Lisa,
in Treviso around 1495. It is not known whether Tinctoris had
any say in the publication at all (see also <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2006b">Woodley 2006b</a>), though it is possible that
contact had been made in the course of his travels before or after
leaving Naples. The work's original dedicatory letter to Beatrice
seems to have remained unrevised since the 1470s, despite the
changes to Beatrice's position and status: similar cases of textual
fidelity in the face of altered circumstance are observable in
the manuscript sources of other treatises.</p>

<p>In the early 1480s Tinctoris embarked on his most ambitious
piece of writing, the treatise <i>De inventione et usu musice</i>;
this was a very large-scale treatment of (apparently) the origins
and evolution of music, its theological and metaphysical roots
and ramifications, and a broad survey of vocal and intrumental
practice, as known to the author. Embedded in this work was a
revision and enlargement of another early treatise, the <i>Complexus
effectuum musices</i>, originally dedicated again to Beatrice
and functioning as a courtly sourcebook of literary and historical
quotations on the effects (or 'meaning') of music &ndash; physical,
emotional and spiritual &ndash; on human beings and their relationship
with God and the universe (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#zanoncelli1979">Zanoncelli 1979</a>; also <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#wegman1995">Wegman 1995</a> and <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#page1996">Page 1996</a>). The complete version of <i>De inventione</i>,
in five books of perhaps some 100 chapters, has not survived,
but calculations suggest that its size was roughly comparable
with the rest of Tinctoris's theoretical work put together, and
there is some evidence that the Valencia manuscript may have been
one of a pair, the other (lost) volume containing this treatise
intact (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1985">Woodley 1985</a>). What has survived is a single copy of a print (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#weinmann1961"
target="frame3017787">Weinmann 1961</a>), made probably by Mathias
Moravus in Naples around 1481&ndash;83, containing extracts from the work, prefaced
by a printed letter from Tinctoris to the singer and composer
Johannes Stokem in Buda, in which he transmits his good wishes
to Beatrice, by then Queen of Hungary. A brief passage after this
letter, probably written by the printer himself or an informed
editor, tells us that Tinctoris had dedicated the full treatise
to his (recently?) deceased father, Martin. These printed extracts
cover a range of material &ndash; more anecdotal than pedagogical or
strictly 'theoretical' &ndash; focusing principally on ancient and
contemporary instrumental and vocal practice. A number of renowned
singers known to Tinctoris are named, with their voice functions:
the Cypriot but Brabant-educated Philippus de Passagio (Philippe
du Passaige), <i>tenorista bassus</i>; Wassettus of Cambrai (Guillaume
Wasset), <i>tenorista altus</i>; Joannes Okeghem, <i>contratenorista
bassus</i>; the Fleming Jacobus Teunis, <i>contratenorista altus</i>;
and Joannes de Lotinis of Dinant, soprano (the dedicatee of the
<i>Expositio manus</i>). Other discussion includes coverage of
various wind instruments (with a number of sub-species such as
the tibia, celimela, dulcina, bombarda and sackbut), and stringed
instruments (lute, lyra, viola, rebec, ghiterra, cetula and tambura),
in which details of stringing, tuning, bowing and finger/plectrum
technique are analysed (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#baines1950">Baines 1950</a>). It is clear, however, that lost portions
of the treatise also contained further coverage of some of these
areas. Noted instrumentalists named are Godefridus Germanus, <i>tibicen</i>
to the Emperor Frederick; Petrus Bonus (Pietrobono), lutenist
to Ercole d'Este of Ferrara; Henricus, lutenist to Charles, Duke
of Burgundy; and the Flemish brothers Carolus and Johannes Orbus,
exponents of the bowed <i>viola</i> (vihuela). In an earlier passage,
Tinctoris recounts with astonishment how he heard the musician
Gerard of Brabant, <i>aulicus</i> to the Duke of Bourbon, singing
and whistling simultaneously two parts of the song <i>Tout a par
moy</i> outside Chartres Cathedral (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#weinmann1961">Weinmann 1961</a>: 34).</p>

<p>It seems likely that the complete version of <i>De inventione</i>
was circulating in northern Europe in the late fifteenth century
as well as the printed extracts, since an epitomized selection
of other, otherwise unknown chapters survive in Cambrai, Biblioth&egrave;que
Municipale, MS&nbsp;A16, fols.&nbsp;8<span class="super">v</span>&ndash;12<span class="super">v</span> (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1985">Woodley 1985</a>). This selection includes
the enlarged <i>Complexus</i> in abridged form, and its accurate
retention of book and chapter identification enables the scope
of the original treatise to be roughly computed.</p>

<p>In addition to his musical writings, Tinctoris was commissioned
by Ferrante to prepare a translation, from Burgundian French into
Italian, of the articles of constitution for the Order of the
Golden Fleece, on the occasion of Ferrante's election to the Order
in May 1473. Tinctoris's translation (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1988"
target="frame3017787">Woodley 1988</a>), demonstrating a high
degree of linguistic fluency (details refined in <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#dagostino1999">D'Agostino 1999</a>), survives in a fine decorated manuscript,
Naples, Biblioteca Nazionale, MS&nbsp;XIV.D.20, the execution
of which can be attributed to the accomplished court scribe Joanmarco
Cinico, and is datable to <i>c</i>.&nbsp;1476&ndash;77. The personal connections
involved here are further strengthened by the survival of a letter
in Latin from Tinctoris to Cinico (Naples, Biblioteca Nazionale,
MS&nbsp;XII.F.50, fols.&nbsp;11&ndash;14), possibly though not incontestably an autograph fair
copy; this is effectively a short humanistic tract on the follies
of earthly riches, fame, honour, power and pleasure. The letter,
perhaps dating from <i>c</i>.&nbsp;1495 on a return to the area of Naples and Pozzuoli after the author's departure
from Ferrante's court, expresses a disaffection with courtly life which
was probably more than simply rhetorical (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1988"
target="frame3017787">Woodley 1988</a>: 198&ndash;202). According
to Trithemius (who was himself writing at exactly this time),
Tinctoris wrote a number of finely-wrought letters ('Epistolas ornatissimas complures dedit ad diversos.': <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1981">Woodley 1981</a>: 247); but, apart
from the brief salutation to Stokem which prefaces the printed
<i>De inventione</i> extracts &ndash; which itself may be one of several
individually printed 'compliment slips' &ndash; the Cinico letter is
the only one  from the author known to have survived.</p>

<p>Throughout his writings Tinctoris engages, explicitly or implicitly,
with a wide range of practical, theoretical and intellectual issues
in the music of his time, broaching questions of artistic creativity,
the theology and ethics of art, aesthetics, and the changing conceptions of
the individual that were emerging in what we term late medieval
and early Renaissance European society. His contemporaries clearly
respected him highly during his life as a musican and writer of
considerable talent, and his reputation was geographically widespread,
from northern Europe to the south of Italy, and from Spain to
central and eastern Europe. He seems to have known personally,
or at close second hand, many of the best composers and practising
musicians of his day, acquaintances having been forged especially
during his time in the Low Countries, northern France and the
Loire Valley, as well as in the course of his travels within Italy. (On the wider classical resonances of such relationships, see also <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#holfordstrevens1996">Holford-Strevens 1996</a>.)
Although he is not known to have worked at the Burgundian court,
he had direct access to some of the best sources of, for example,
the works of Busnoys and the Englishman Robert Morton, and may
even have visited them in the mid-1470s. He was famously included
in the list of musicians named in Comp&egrave;re's motet <i>Omnium
bonorum plena</i> (late 1460s or early 1470s), and he was deeply
influential in the thinking and writings of Franchino Gafori,
whom he knew personally from the latter's stay in Naples around
1478&ndash;80 (see also <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#dagostino2005">D'Agostino 2005</a>). Tinctoris's wider influence in later years is, however,
difficult to assess, and would undoubtedly have been greater if
more of his writings had, like those of Gafori, been committed
to print. Nevertheless, immediately after his death his work was
still known and highly regarded, both in Italy and in pockets
of northern Europe, as witnessed by the detailed points of discussion
raised in the correspondence between Giovanni Spataro, Marc'Antonio
Cavazzoni, Pietro Aaron and Giovanni del Lago (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#blackburn1991"
target="frame3017787">Blackburn 1991</a>), and also by the references
in, for example, the <i>Micrologus</i> of Ornithoparcus and Sebald
Heyden's <i>De arte canendi</i>, as well as a small constellation
of sources centred on Glareanus. In old age, Tinctoris saw three
of his compositions published by Petrucci (see <b><a href="#anchor1528286">IV.&nbsp;Music</a></b>
below). Antiquarian knowledge, and some full-scale copying, of
his writings surfaces in the eighteenth century, most notably
in the correspondence and other work of Padre Martini. In the
late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries Tinctoris's profile
in France was gradually raised in the course of a proposal to
publish and translate the contents of the main Brussels manuscript;
and a similar venture by F&eacute;tis later in the nineteenth
century, in Belgium, eventually led indirectly to Coussemaker's
edition of 1875, incorporated the following year into his four-volume
<i>Scriptorum medii aevi nova series</i> (discussed in <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2007">Woodley 2007a</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="anchor1526603" id="anchor1526603"></a>III. Principal manuscript sources:
a brief sketch</h3>

<p>Although Tinctoris's treatises survive in relatively few fifteenth-century manuscript
sources (the principal of which are itemised <a href="work_list.html#ms_sigla" target="frame3017784">here</a>), three of these should be regarded as of particular historical
and textual value.</p>

<p>Links to full descriptions of all MS and primary printed sources will follow
in due course.</p>

<p><b><a name="sources_sketch_brussels4147" id="sources_sketch_brussels4147"></a>Brussels, Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, MS&nbsp;II&nbsp;4147</b>
provides generally the most accurate texts, and, whilst it is
not without error (especially in areas relating to chant theory),
it seems to have originated in close proximity to the author.
It was compiled in Naples around the early 1480s (i.e. while Tinctoris
was still in Ferrante's employment there), and may be a fair copy
made for or by a knowledgeable chapel musician at the court, probably
&ndash; in view of the handwriting &ndash; one of Tinctoris's northern European
colleagues. It seems to have remained in Italy until the eighteenth
century, and was brought to Paris in 1794 by the  musician
and bibliophile Gaspare Selvaggi, passing subsequently into the
collections of Fayolle, Perne and F&eacute;tis. A discussion of the manuscript's history, especially in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, is given in <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2007">Woodley 2007a</a>, the <a href="contents.html#brussels4147appendix" target="frame3017786">Appendix</a> of which presents a full description of the manuscript. </p>

<p><b><a name="sources_sketch_valencia835" id="sources_sketch_valencia835"></a>Valencia, Biblioteca General i Hist&ograve;rica de la Universitat, MS&nbsp;835</b> is a
sumptuously illuminated manuscript executed in Naples during Tinctoris's time at court, perhaps around 1483&ndash;85, and probably originally for the library of Ferrante's son Cardinal Giovanni d'Aragona. (According to <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#haffner1997">Haffner 1997</a>: 315&ndash;19 the <a href="../../Images/v_fol2_arms.jpg" target="_blank">Aragonese arms</a> painted on the <a href="../../Images/v_fol2.jpg" target="_blank">frontispiece</a> originally displayed a cardinal's hat, matching other manuscripts belonging to Giovanni, but this has subsequently been overpainted, presumably following his death in 1485, the manuscript possibly  reverting to Ferrante's own library. See also <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#dagostino1999">D'Agostino 1999</a>: 357&ndash;60; and <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2007">Woodley 2007a</a>: &sect;2.) The
main text was copied by the Bohemian scribe Wenceslaus Crispus,
and the decoration, including a portrait of Tinctoris,
was probably the joint work of Cristoforo Majorana, Matteo Felice
and Cola Rapicano. The manuscript includes, at beginning and end,
two Latin eulogies to Tinctoris, written by an Olivetan monk,
Brother Fortunatus of Ferrara, who may have been attached to the
White Benedictine church of Santa Maria di Monte Oliveto (now
Sant'Anna dei Lombardi) in Naples, which was especially favoured
by the royal court. The second of these eulogies, though ambiguously
worded, may indicate that the line drawing of a human head on
the following page (fol.&nbsp;164<span class="super">v</span>) is a depiction of Musica made
by Tinctoris's own hand. The <a href="../../Images/v_fol2.jpg"
target="_blank">frontispiece</a> (fol. 2: opening of the
<i>Expositio manus</i>) contains a <a href="../../Images/v_jtlarge.jpg"
target="_blank">miniature portrait</a> of Tinctoris, probably
taken from life, showing the author seated at a desk reading,
perhaps in the room known to have been set aside for music studies
in the Castel Nuovo in Naples. The manuscript came to Valencia
in the early sixteenth century, in the collection of Fernando
de Arag&oacute;n, Duke of Calabria, after the fall of the Kingdom
of Naples; it was given to the monastery of San Miguel de los
Reyes in 1550, and passed into the University Library upon the
suppression of the monastery in 1825. [Full description to follow: also discussed in <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2007">Woodley 2007a</a>.]</p>
<p><b><a name="sources_sketch_bologna2573" id="sources_sketch_bologna2573"></a>Bologna, Biblioteca Universitaria, MS&nbsp;2573</b> is also
of Neapolitan provenance, though probably dating from the 1490s,
after Tinctoris's departure. The scribe of this beautifully produced
manuscript was almost certainly, again, Wenceslaus Crispus, at
a slightly more developed stage in his career, and some parts
of the texts have been revised for reasons of literary style rather
than content, though it is not clear whether the author was responsible
for these emendations. The function and destination of the manuscript
is still problematical, but the presence of Tinctoris's motet
<i>Virgo dei throno digna</i> at the head of the codex may suggest
a connection with Beatrice, perhaps a gift to celebrate or anticipate
her eventual return to Naples from Hungary in 1500. It passed
subsequently into the monastery of San Salvatore in Bologna, whence
it was confiscated in 1796 by the French revolutionary armies
in the course of their Italian campaign. This seizure resulted
in the deposit of the manuscript in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale
in Paris, until its return on 28&nbsp;October 1815 to Bologna,
this time to the Biblioteca Universitaria, its present home. [Full

<h3><a name="anchor1528286" id="anchor1528286"></a>IV. Music</h3>

<p>Apart from his distinction as a theorist, Tinctoris shows himself
to be an accomplished composer &ndash; not perhaps with the depth of
inventiveness of Busnoys or Okeghem, but demonstrating a stylistic
kinship with them which corroborates the rhetoric of his treatises (works collected in <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#melin1976">Melin 1976</a>).
His surviving output is quite small; indeed the pattern of sources
today suggests that he wrote nothing of consequence prior to his
move to Naples, with the possible exception of his rondeau <i>Vostre
regart</i>, though it is intrinsically highly likely that he had
already been active as a composer during his time at Orl&eacute;ans
and Chartres. The treatises themselves, aside from their very numerous, short technical illustrations of notational practice, contain a significant number of fully composed, albeit brief, polyphonic pieces which demonstrate the larger compositional context of the theoretical principles described. </p>

<p>Tinctoris's most impressive, sustained work is the four-voiced <i>L'Homme
arm&eacute;</i> mass. Its use of the (specially composed?) trope
text 'Cunctorum plasmator summus' in the Kyrie, 'Cherubim ac Seraphim
ceterique spiritus angelici' in the Sanctus, and a version of
the Palm Sunday antiphon <i>Pueri Hebreorum</i> in the Osanna,
suggests a possible influence from the six anonymous <i>L'Homme
arm&eacute;</i> masses in Naples, Biblioteca Nazionale, MS&nbsp;VI.E.40,
dating from <i>c</i>.&nbsp;1476; and since the unique source of
the Tinctoris mass, Vatican Library, Cappella Sistina MS&nbsp;35,
dates from <i>c</i>.&nbsp;1487, its composition can be tentatively
placed around the early 1480s. Tinctoris's other four-voiced mass
(in the edition of <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#melin1976">Melin 1976</a>: <i>Missa sine nomine</i> No.&nbsp;3) lacks the Kyrie
and Agnus, and has a foreshortened Credo text; the provenance
of its only source, Milan Cathedral, Archivio della Cappella Musicale
del Duomo, Librone&nbsp;2 (<i>olim</i> 2268) may indicate that
its composition relates in some way to Tinctoris's acquaintance
with Gafori in Naples, in the late 1470s. The two three-voiced
masses (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#melin1976">Melin 1976</a>: <i>Missae sine nomine</i> Nos.&nbsp;1 and 2) seem
in some ways to be conceived as a complementary pairing, the first
in a very unusual configuration of low clefs, with the contratenor
descending to B&nbsp;flat below gamma ut, and the second in high
clefs, with the tenor ascending to F <i>extra manum</i>. No precomposed
material has yet been traced in these two works, but the sole
source of the first, Verona, Biblioteca Capitolare, MS&nbsp;755,
gives a Latin inscription to Ferrante, apparently written by Tinctoris:
'Ferdinande sacer inter divos referende&nbsp;| Cantica Tinctoris
suscipe parva tui.' At least this mass, therefore, presumably
dates from the 1470s or 1480s. All four of these masses show a
strong and confident compositional hand, with clearly articulated
but nuanced motivic relationships at work, and often characterized
by closely imitative head-motifs initiating movements and secondary
head-motifs relating their subdivisions. Tinctoris's melodic fluency
and contrapuntal technique are, as one might expect, highly developed,
and only slightly more clich&eacute;d than those of the composer's
most distinguished contemporaries.</p>

<p>Other surviving sacred or devotional works include a fine setting
of the Lamentations of Jeremiah (<i>Lamentationes Jeremiae</i>),
and two short motets, <i>O virgo miserere mei</i> and <i>Virgo
dei throno digna</i>. The Lamentations, appearing uniquely in
the 1506 printed collection of Petrucci, are probably quite late
in date, as some details of dissonance treatment reveal contrapuntal
criteria that extend those of the <i>Liber de arte contrapuncti</i>.
The work may therefore date from the 1490s, or even after the
turn of the century, and, in common with some other early polyphonic
examples of the genre, its text is somewhat abbreviated, setting
only Aleph, Beth and Ghimel. The two (ostensibly Marian) motets
appear for the first time (<i>O virgo miserere mei</i> uniquely)
in the Mellon Chansonnier (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#perkinsgarey1979"
target="frame3017787">Perkins &amp; Garey 1979</a>), a collection
mainly of songs which was almost certainly compiled in the mid-1470s
by Tinctoris himself, eventually as a wedding gift to Princess
Beatrice: <i>Virgo dei throno digna</i>, which subsequently became
quite widely disseminated in manuscript collections as well as
printed in Petrucci's <i>Motetti&nbsp;A</i>, alludes implicitly
to Beatrice's forthcoming role as Queen of Hungary. Both pieces
have been interpreted as containing elaborate numerological and
gematriacal references to Tinctoris's and Beatrice's names (<a
href="../Bibliography/index.html#benthem1982">Van
Benthem 1982</a>).</p>

<p>Tinctoris's other extant works include a widely copied, though
generally textless song <i>H&eacute;las</i> (ascribed in one source
to Comp&egrave;re; also printed in Petrucci's <i>Odhecaton A</i>),
a brief three-voiced setting of an Italian text, <i>O invida fortuna</i>,
and a four-voiced setting of <i>Le souvenir</i>. There are also
a number of short but mensurally and rhythmically interesting
pieces, mainly in two voices, usually untexted and in some cases
duplicating examples given in the treatises. These seem to function
only partly as abstract contrapuntal exercises, and may more fruitfully
be seen as notated approximations of extemporized vocal and instrumental
practice, such as Tinctoris may himself have known as singer or
player of the rebec and bowed vihuela. Of more clearly pedagogical
intent is the 'motet' <i>Difficiles alios delectat pangere cantus</i>,
a work from the 1470s identified and analysed by Bonnie Blackburn (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#blackburn1981">Blackburn 1981</a>),
which contains numerous complex mensural, proportional and other
notational features that are commented upon at length by the marginal
annotator of its source, Perugia, Biblioteca Comunale Augusta,
MS&nbsp;1013, and further discussed, albeit as the work of an
already slightly antique figure, in the Spataro correspondence
(<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#blackburn1991">Blackburn
1991</a>) of some fifty years later.</p>
