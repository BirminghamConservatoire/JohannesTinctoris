      <p>The manuscript Universitat de València, Biblioteca Històrica,
        MS 835 (henceforth <b>V</b>) is one of the central sources for
        our work on this new online Tinctoris edition, and for our
        ongoing research into the historical and textual
        interrelationships of the surviving fifteenth-century
        witnesses to Tinctoris’s writings. The manuscript has become
        especially familiar to modern musicology because of its superb
        architectural frontispiece (fol. 2) that incorporates the now
        famous ‘portrait’ miniature of the author seated in a study,
        after the iconographical manner of St Jerome, presumably in
        the Castel Nuovo in Naples, reading a manuscript clearly
        depicting – albeit somewhat schematically – musical
        notation. The portrait, now widely disseminated in the modern
        musicological literature, is shown on the front page of this
        online project; the full frontispiece, into which is
        incorporated the opening of Tinctoris’s <em>Expositio manus</em>, is
        shown here as Figure 1.</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure1"></a>Figure 1</strong>. Valencia,
        Universitat de València, Biblioteca Històrica, MS 835,
        fol. 2r</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_01.png" alt="figure1"
              class="clickToZoom" height="550px" width="394px"/></p>

      <p>Although the portrait of the author certainly still merits
      much more detailed research, the focus of the present short
      essay is rather on the lower part of the frontispiece,
      displaying the armorial shield with its various component parts
      and decoration, and on the implications of these for the
      manuscript’s precise dating and provenance. It has long been
      recognized that the arms depicted are those of the royal House
      of Aragon: this has been acknowledged in modern scholarship at
      least from the early twentieth century, in the 1913 catalogue of
      the manuscripts of the Valencia University Library by Gutiérrez
      del Caño
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#gutierrezdelcano1913">Gutiérrez del
      Caño 1913</a>, iii. 234–5), and later, especially, the
      monumental multi-volume work of Tammaro de Marinis on the
      Aragonese royal library at Naples in the fifteenth and early
      sixteenth centuries
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#demarinis1947">De
      Marinis 1947–69</a>, esp. ii. 164–5). In the musicological
      literature, aside from a few references <em>en passant</em>, the
      manuscript rose to major prominence in Tinctoris studies with
      the pioneering work of Leeman Perkins, as part of his
      collaborative edition, with Howard Garey, of the Mellon
      Chansonier
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#perkinsgarey1979">Perkins &
      Garey 1979</a>, esp. i. 22–26). Up until the 1990s the
      assumption – sometimes stated, sometimes implicit – was that the
      Aragonese arms of the frontispiece (Type 15 of De Marinis’s
      taxonomy: <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#demarinis1947">De
          Marinis 1947–69</a>, ii. Plate B), together with its surmounted
      five-point ‘lily crown’, indicated that the manuscript – a work
      of undoubtedly very high prestige and luxury, uncommon for music
      theory at the time – had been executed for King Ferrante,
      Tinctoris’s direct employer, himself.</p>

      <p>In 1997 a significant revision to this presumed provenance
      was offered by Thomas Haffner in a monograph devoted to the
      library of one of Ferrante’s sons, Giovanni d’Aragona
      (1456–1485), who became Cardinal of Naples in December 1477, and
      was renowned for his book collecting and cultural aspirations
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#haffner1997">Haffner
      1997</a>). Crucially, Haffner observed for the first time –
      though now it seems glaringly obvious – that the five-pointed
      crown surmounting the Aragonese arms on the frontispiece
      of <b>V</b> shows clear signs of overpainting.</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure2"></a>Figure 2</strong>. Valencia,
      Universitat de València, Biblioteca Històrica, MS 835, fol. 2r
      (detail)</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_02.png" alt="figure2"
              class="clickToZoom"/></p>

      <p>By analogy with a number of other Aragonese manuscripts
      displaying similar overpaintings, and clearly linked with the
      library of Giovanni d’Aragona, Haffner proposed that the image
      originally painted in this location was most likely that of the
      cardinal’s red hat, demonstrating that the Tinctoris manuscript
      must have been executed primarily for Giovanni himself, rather
      than Ferrante
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#haffner1997">Haffner
      1997</a>, 315–19; Catalogue No. 34). For musicologists, this was
      in many ways an attractive proposition, partly because it opened
      up a rather richer landscape of cultural and bibliophilic
      relationships at the Neapolitan court, and partly because it
      seemed to demonstrate that Tinctoris’s musical, and perhaps
      pedagogical, relationships with Ferrante’s offspring were more
      widely shared than simply with the king’s daughter Beatrice,
      whose status as dedicatee and probable student of the theorist
      is well attested. Most of all, though, the ascription
      of <b>V</b> to the library of Giovanni d’Aragona held important
      implications for the manuscript’s dating. Since Giovanni died on
      17 October 1485, and as already stated had become cardinal at
      the end of 1477, the proposed provenance enabled codicologists,
      and hence musicologists, to narrow the window for the
      compilation of the manuscript to this period of under eight
      years, within which Haffner settles on a date of <em>c</em>. 1483. This
      provenance and dating were once more taken up, in the year
      following publication of Haffner’s monograph, by Gennaro Toscano
      in the most detailed research on the Aragonese royal library at
      Naples undertaken since De Marinis, published in parallel with
      the exhibition ‘La Biblioteca Reale di Napoli al tempo della
      dinastia aragonese’, held in the Castel Nuovo from 30 September
      to 15 December 1998
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#toscano1998">Toscano
      1998</a>). Among the wide-ranging and impressive art-historical
      research contained in this volume is the observation that the
      frontispiece of <b>V</b> now seems securely attributable to
      Nardo Rapicano, a refinement of previous suggestions involving
      another member of the same family (father?), Cola (for example,
        <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1982">Woodley
      1982</a>, i. 131, following discussions with the Italian Renaissance manuscript specialist A. C. de la Mare),
      as well as other known Neapolitan court illuminators of the late
      fifteenth century, such as Cristoforo Majorana and Matteo Felice
      (for
      example, <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#perkinsgarey1979">Perkins
      & Garey 1979</a>, i. 22–6).</p>

      <p>There are, however, at least two serious obstacles to the
      assertion that the overpainting of the crown above the Aragonese
      arms of <b>V</b> (<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>) conceals an
      original depiction of a cardinal’s hat. The first such obstacle
      is purely iconographical, since an intrinsic part of a
      cardinal’s emblem, in contexts such as this, is the
      incorporation of the red <i>fiocchi</i> or series of knotted
      tassles that conventionally hang down from either side of the
      hat. An instance of this, in the frontispiece of Valencia MS 390
      (Albertus Magnus, <i>Summa theologie, sive De mirabili scientia
      Dei</i>), a manuscript identified as belonging to Giovanni
      d’Aragona as early as 1527 in an inventory of Neapolitan
      manuscripts then in Ferrara
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#cherchiderobertis1990">Cherchi
      & De Robertis 1990</a>, 161, No. 57), is shown in Figure 3.</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure3"></a>Figure 3</strong>. Valencia,
        Universitat de València, Biblioteca Històrica, MS 390, fol. 1r
        (detail)</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_03.png" alt="figure3"
              class="clickToZoom"/></p>

      <p>In this example there is in fact rather more distance between
      the hat and the <em>fiocchi</em> than is customary, as can be seen by comparison with Figure 4 (Rouen, Bibliothèque municipale, MS A 13: Leonardo Nogarola, <em>Tractatus de mundi eternitate</em>, a book dedicated to Giovanni d’Aragona and dated 13 April 1485, only six months before Giovanni’s death). Similar designs can also be found in a number of
      greyscale images from manuscripts associated with Giovanni, reproduced by Haffner
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#haffner1997">Haffner
      1997</a>, e.g. Appendix No. 51, from Naples, Archivio di Stato,
      Museo Storico, MS 99.C.1, fol. 17).</p>
      <p><strong><a id="figure4"></a>Figure 4</strong>. Rouen,
        Bibliothèque municipale, MS A 13, fol 3r (detail)</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_04.png" alt="figure4"
              class="clickToZoom"/></p>

      <p>If we turn again to <b>V</b> (<a href="#figure2">Figure
      2</a>), close inspection reveals that the overpainting is
      restricted to the immediate area of the crown, between the heads
      of the two upper <i>putti</i>, perhaps with a little
      re-contouring or touching-up of the <em>putti</em>’s rearmost arms. In
      addition, the purely decorative (i.e. non-emblematic) gold
      ribbons that curl down between the pairs of <i>putti</i> and the
      shield show no sign of interference or repainting, this despite
      the very small horizontal (accidental?) patch between the arms
      of the upper right <i>putto</i>, probably in the same pigment as
      the main overpainting above. There is, in short, no trace
      whatever of any pre-existing <i>fiocchi</i> that might have
      (indeed, should have) been hanging down either side of the
      shield, had there been a cardinal’s emblem depicted.</p>

      <p>The second obstacle to the argument favouring an original image of a cardinal’s hat concerns the
        show-through from this area of the frontispiece on
        fol. 2 <i>recto</i> to the corresponding area of fol. 2
        <i>verso</i>. Unlike some Aragonese manuscripts, in which the
        scribe or atelier has recognized the problems of staining
        sometimes caused by show-through from elaborate frontispieces,
        resulting in an extra sheet of vellum being pasted on to the
        <i>verso</i> before the main text there was written, the
        show-through of <b>V</b> is quite apparent (Figure 5).</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure5"></a>Figure 5</strong>. Valencia,
      Universitat de València, Biblioteca Històrica, MS 835, fol. 2v
      (detail)</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_05.png" alt="figure5"
              class="clickToZoom"/></p>

      <p>The crucial thing to observe here is that, whilst there is
      noticeable leaching of the red pigment from the ground of the
      red and gold Aragonese <i>pali</i>, and from the <i>putti</i>’s
      wings, through to the <i>verso</i> of the leaf, the only slight
      coloration of the area corresponding to the crown on
      the <i>recto</i> is of a greyish hue, similar to that
      corresponding to the predominantly grey and blue tones of the
      second and third quarters of the arms (separate elements
      representing claims of the Neapolitan throne to Hungary,
      Anjou and Jerusalem).</p>

      <p>Far from deepening our perplexity, however, on the question
      of the overpainting of the crown, this distinction in the
      colouring of the show-through may actually suggest a
      solution. Returning briefly to the biography of Giovanni
      d’Aragona, we know that he was made prothonotary apostolic at
      the astonishingly young age of barely nine (12 July 1465:
        <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#miranda1998">Miranda
          1998–</a>, s.v. ‘Aragona, Giovanni d’ (1456–1485)’). In the
      period between the conferral of this status and his later rise
      to the cardinalate from December 1477, the correct heraldic
      emblem to be applied to him as part of any manuscript armorial
      bearings (along with the Aragonese royal arms themselves) would
      have been that of the prothonotary’s hat, always depicted in
      this period as coloured grey, and almost always of slightly
      different proportions to those of the cardinal’s hat, being
      rather wider-brimmed than the latter. An example of this, in a
      copy of Thomas Aquinas, <i>De ente et essentia</i> (and other
      texts) dated by Haffner to around 1472
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#haffner1997">Haffner
      1997</a>, 339–41), now survives as Valencia MS 847, reproduced here
      as Figure 6.</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure6"></a>Figure 6</strong>. Valencia,
      Universitat de València, Biblioteca Històrica, MS 847, fol. 2r
      (detail)</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_06.png" alt="figure6" class="clickToZoom"/></p>

      <p>Another version of the same can be found in a further
      manuscript from Giovanni’s library, a copy of Porphyry,
        <i>Isagoge ad cathegorias Aristotelis</i>, with other Latin
      texts of Aristotle and Gilbertus Porreta, dated by Haffner to
      around 1473
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#haffner1997">Haffner
      1997</a>, 224–7), surviving as Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de
      France, MS lat. 6292, and reproduced here as Figure 7.</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure7"></a>Figure 7</strong>. Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS
      lat. 6292, fol. 1r (detail)</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_07.png" alt="figure7" class="clickToZoom"/></p>

      <p>It is clear from these two images that, compared with the elaborate <em>fiocchi</em> of the cardinal’s emblem, any equivalent decoration of the prothonotary’s hat was minimal or non-existent. Returning once
        again to the show-through on fol. 1 <i>verso</i> of <b>V</b>,
        it is not impossible to discern a slight contour in the
        staining of the overpainted area above the escutcheon that might
        well indicate the ghost of the shape of such a prothonotary’s
        hat, and the colouring of the stain is certainly at least
        consistent with the notion that this could indeed have been
        the underlying depiction. (We are hoping that the application of new photographic technologies will be permitted in the near future, to help elucidate this feature.) Figure 8 shows an enlarged detail of
        the relevant portion of the whole image given above
        as <a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a>.</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure8"></a>Figure 8</strong>. Valencia,

      (detail).</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_08.png" alt="figure8" class="clickToZoom"/></p>

      <p>By way of further comparison and consolidation of this
      suggestion, it is useful to look at one or two examples of
      manuscripts in which overpainting has again occurred, but with
      definite indication of the underlying image having been that of
      the cardinal’s hat. (It is often not entirely clear why this has
      occurred – there are quite a number of instances recorded – but
      a likely explanation in at least some cases must have been the
      desire to ensure continued Aragonese royal ownership, perhaps
      often reverting to the king himself, after Giovanni’s
      unexpectedly early death in 1485.) An instance of this can be
      found in Valencia MS 389, a fine copy of Aulus Gellius, <i>Noctes
      Atticae</i>, probably from the early 1480s, whose frontispiece
      can again be attributed to Nardo Rapicano (note especially the
      facial characteristics of the <i>putti</i>, very similar to
      those of <b>V</b>). Here (Figure 9) it is very clear from the
      overpainting, the pigment alterations and disturbance to the
      original design, that the hat underlying the crown was also
      accompanied by <i>fiocchi</i> hanging down into the space
      separating the heads of the two middle <i>putti</i>: there can
      be little doubt that in this case Haffner’s identification of an
      original cardinal’s hat
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#haffner1997">Haffner
      1997</a>, 271–6) is correct.</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure9"></a>Figure 9</strong>. Valencia,

      <p>Similarly, a copy of Thomas Aquinas, <i>Summa theologica:
          Prima secunda</i>, dated 1484 and surviving as Valencia MS 395,
          clearly shows a ghosting of the knotted tassles of the
        <i>fiocchi</i> beneath the overpainted blue ground, even
          though only a tiny portion of the original brim of the hat
          is discernible to the immediate left of the crown (Figure
          10). The main scribe of this manuscript was in fact
          Venceslaus Crispus, who was responsible for <b>V</b>, though
          in the case of Valencia MS 395 the illumination has been
          attributed by Toscano to Cristoforo Majorana, rather than
          the Rapicano family
          (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#toscano1998">Toscano
          1998</a>, 610).</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure10"></a>Figure 10</strong>. Valencia, Universitat de
      València, Biblioteca Històrica, MS 395, fol. 2r (detail)</p>

      <p>And finally, an example of a different kind of treatment of
      the redundant or outdated cardinal’s emblem. Paris, Bibliothèque
      nationale de France, MS lat. 8016 (Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i>,
      from around 1483) shows a process of erasure rather than
      overpainting; but here, once again, it is clear that both hat
      and <i>fiocchi</i> were jointly present in the manuscript’s
      original state, extending down each side of the armorial shield
      into the bottom spaces under the feet of the <i>putti</i>
      (Figure 11). Haffner additionally reports that upon physical
      inspection with a light source, the red hat and <i>fiocchi</i>
      are still visible
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#haffner1997">Haffner
      1997</a>, 232), though no sign of these is apparent as
      show-through on the following <i>verso</i>, at least as
      discernible in the facsimiles available from the library’s
      online Gallica resource
      (<a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8452774s.r=8016">http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8452774s.r=8016</a>).</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure11"></a>Figure 11</strong>. Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS
      lat. 8016, fol. 1r (detail)</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_11.png" alt="figure11" class="clickToZoom"/></p>

      <p>We have to ask, however, at this point: is there any other
      heraldic device, beyond the possibilities of the cardinal’s or
      prothonotary’s hat, that could have been placed originally above
      the frontispiece shield of <b>V</b>? In the context of late
      fifteenth-century Neapolitan royal manuscripts, there is really
      only one further candidate that merits consideration. This
      concerns not Giovanni, nor Beatrice, but another son of
      Ferrante, Alfonso (1448–1495), destined to become King Alfonso
      II after Ferrante’s death in 1494. As Ferrante’s first-born son,
      Alfonso carried the title Duke of Calabria, and as such he
      bore arms proper to that title. The principal device associated
      with this was a ringed, studded coronet, which clearly occurs in
      the decoration of a number of manuscripts from Alfonso’s own
      collection. Moreover, as a particularly energetic and generous
      cultural patron, with credentials for, and apparently genuine
      personal interests in, the support of the Neapolitan court’s
      literary, artistic and architectural ambitions (see especially
        <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#hersey1969">Hersey
      1969</a>), it would not be difficult to weave an argument in
      favour of Alfonso as a likely commissioner of <b>V</b>. In turn,
      it might have been seen as relevant, in such a context, that the
      two eulogies to Tinctoris and his work, written by the Olivetan
      monk Fortunatus of Ferrara, which book-end the main contents of
        <b>V</b>, and which will be the subject of a separate essay
      within this online project, could be indirectly associated with
      Alfonso, since it is known that the main Olivetan church in
      Naples, Santa Maria de Monte Oliveto (now Sant’Anna dei
      Lombardi) was particularly favoured by the prince
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#hersey1969">Hersey
      1969</a>, 109–10). However, closer iconographical investigation
      of the manuscripts associated with Alfonso (see, for instance,
        <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#toscano1998">Toscano
      1998</a>, esp. 251–76 and associated Plates;
      also <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#demarinis1947">De
      Marinis 1947–69</a>) suggests very strongly that the coronet was
      depicted only in association with the personal arms of the Duke
        of Calabria, quartered into Aragonese <i>pali</i> (2 and 3, or 1 and 4)
      and large cross of Jerusalem on a grey ground (1 and 4, or 2 and
      3 respectively). Whilst some of Alfonso’s manuscripts do carry
      the more general, full Aragonese royal arms, such as we have
      seen throughout the present essay, these are always accompanied
      by the surmounted crown, not the coronet. (I have found one
      example of the coronet with normal Aragonese arms (Valencia MS 132:
        <i>Pauli Paladini Pharii apud Tarentum habita oratio</i>,
        <em>c</em>. 1496), but as a book dedicated to Federico, Duke of Calabria
      after Ferrante’s and Alfonso’s deaths, this belongs to a later
      generation of the Dukedom, and seems to represent a new heraldic
      convention.) The arms of Alfonso as Duke of Calabria, with
      surmounted coronet, can be seen in Figures 12 and 13 (Paris,
      Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS lat. 8533: [part 1] Cicero, <i>Epistolae ad familiares</i>; [part 2] Cicero, <i>Epistulae
          ad Brutum</i>; <i>ad Quintum fratrem</i>; <i>ad
          Atticum</i>); it is clear that these arms cannot in any way
          be confused with the surviving (original) armorial shield
          of <b>V</b>.</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure12"></a>Figure 12</strong>. Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS
      lat. 8533 (part 1), fol. 1r (detail)</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_12.png" alt="figure12" class="clickToZoom"/></p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure13"></a>Figure 13</strong>. Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS
      lat. 8533 (part 2), fol. 1r (detail)</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_13.png" alt="figure13" class="clickToZoom"/></p>

      <p>The cumulative evidence here indicates that it is all but
      inconceivable that the arms of <b>V</b> ever
      displayed <i>fiocchi</i> hanging down either side of the
      armorial shield; in consequence, it is extremely unlikely that
      the present five-pointed lily crown was painted over a red
      cardinal’s hat. It is, however, entirely plausible – especially
      bearing in mind the particular design of Aragonese arms depicted
      on the shield, the nature of the show-through, and the fact that the existing decorative golden
      ribbons are clearly original – that the overpainted image was
      rather that of a grey prothonotary’s hat. If this is the case,
      the implications for the dating of <b>V</b> are rather
      interesting. For, in terms of the actual music-theoretical
      content of the manuscript, we should recall that <b>V</b>
      includes the full text of the <i>Liber de arte contrapuncti</i>
      (fols. 77v–144), which we are told, in the version of the
      explicit recorded uniquely in Brussels, Bibliothèque royale, MS
      II 4147, fol. 101ra, was completed on 11 October 1477 (‘Liber
      tercius et ultimus de arte contrapuncti feliciter explicit Quem
      totum magister ioannes tinctoris (Ut prefertur) iurisconsultus
      atque musicus illustrissimi regis sicilie capellanus, neapoli
        incepit absolvitque Anno domini 1477<sup>o</sup>. mensis octobris die
      Undecima | Deum orate pro eo’: see Figure 14).</p>

      <p><strong><a id="figure14"></a>Figure 14</strong>. Brussels, Bibliothèque royale, MS II 4147,
      fol. 101ra (detail)</p>
      <p><img src="Figures/Inline/Figure_14.png" alt="figure14"/></p>

      <p>As we have seen, Giovanni d’Aragona was created cardinal
      (more precisely, cardinal deacon of S. Adriano in Foro in Rome)
      in the consistory of 10 December 1477, although the special
      embassy from Sixtus IV  to present him with the red hat
      did not take place until 25 January 1478 in Naples Cathedral, the presentation being made by the Bishop of Aversa
      (<a href="../Bibliography/index.html#pasztor1961">Pàsztor 1961</a>). The close
      proximity – a mere two months apart, almost to the day – of the
      completion date of <i>De arte contrapuncti</i> (the accuracy of
      which we have no reason to doubt or dispute) and the formal
      appointment of Giovanni to the cardinalate must surely give a
      clue as the reason for the suggested overpainting in the arms of
        <b>V</b>. The manuscript must have been commissioned, planned
      in both principle and detail, and its execution commenced, very
      soon after – or even, indeed, some time before – the completion
      of the counterpoint treatise in October 1477, destined primarily
      for the collection of Giovanni d’Aragona while he was still
      prothonotary apostolic. Then, at some point after news of the
      cardinalate broke – it is simply not possible to say how soon or
      long after – the heraldic inaccuracy led to the alterations that
      we see in the manuscript today. The change of emblem from
      prothonotary’s hat to five-pointed crown does not of itself
      indicate that the manuscript had necessarily left Giovanni’s
      collection for Ferrante’s library – other manuscripts attest to
      its use by Giovanni as a valid alternative – though such a
      transfer may indeed have eventually taken place after Giovanni’s
      premature death in 1485.</p>

      <p>This proposed revision of the dating and origins of <b>V</b>,
      then, to a period between the last few months of 1477 and the
      first few of 1478 suggests a musicological significance that
      goes some way beyond the simple fact of the handful of years
      separating Haffner’s previously proposed date of around 1483
      from the manuscript’s more likely, earlier date of
      execution. For, simply put, it becomes the earliest datable
      source for the main corpus of Tinctoris’s pedagogical
      treatises. There are still, nevertheless, many paths of
      investigation open, and the case presented in this essay can
      hardly be regarded yet as definitive. If future research, for instance, can demonstrate that Alfonso's arms, while he was Duke of Calabria, did sometimes combine the coronet with the full Aragonese escutcheon as seen in <strong>V</strong>, as an alternative to the escutcheon proper to the Dukedom, the question of attribution to him rather than Giovanni should certainly be reopened. Particularly relevant to
      our new online edition of the Tinctoris treatises will be the detailed
      textual relationships between, especially, <b>V</b> and the two
      other central sources, Brussels, Bibliothèque royale, MS II 4147
      (<b>Br1</b>) and Bologna, Biblioteca Universitaria, MS 2573
      (<b>Bu</b>), the latter an especially acute issue since it was
      copied by the same scribe as <b>V</b>, Venceslaus Crispus,
      though its precise dating, and its palaeographical and
      contextual relationship with <b>V</b>, have yet to be fully
      explored. But the historical and textual relationship
      between <b>V</b> and <b>Br1</b> is no less fascinating as a
      result of this suggested revision of date. It has generally been
      presumed, including by the present writer
      (e.g. <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley1982">Woodley
      1982</a>
      and <a href="../Bibliography/index.html#woodley2011">Woodley
      2011</a>) that <b>Br1</b> preceded <b>V</b> by some years during
      the 1480s; but this may turn out not to be the case, since it
      seems that the ink was, as it were, barely dry on the <em>Liber de
      arte contrapuncti</em> in 1477 before the preparation of <b>V</b> was
      under way, and although it is 
      <v><strong>Br1</strong></v> itself that uniquely
      witnesses the treatise’s completion date, the manuscript itself
      may actually post-date <b>V</b>, perhaps placing it
      chronologically in between this source and <b>Bu</b>.</p>

      <p>As these and other strands of our research become gradually
      teased apart, we are intending to continue this series of short,
      focused essays within the project website, as a means of rapidly
      disseminating our thinking as it evolves, as well as stimulating
      wider musicological discussion through our blog and, when it
      becomes available, the user forum, accessed here from the
      project home page.</p>
