<h2>The Production and History of Valencia 835</h2><p class="author">Christian Goursaud (Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, Birmingham City University)</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-1">[1]</span>The splendidly produced manuscript <span class="siglum">E-VAu 835</span> (hereafter <strong>V</strong>) was made at the Aragonese court of Naples during the music theorist Johannes Tinctoris’s period of employment there under King Ferrante I from the 1470s to the 1490s, and is now held in the Biblioteca Històrica of the Universitat de València.<a href="notes.html#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a> Containing nine of Tinctoris’s music-theoretical treatises, it is bound in morocco leather with gold tooling, and features gold illumination and finely painted floral decoration.<a href="notes.html#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">2</a> It opens on fol. 2<sup>r</sup> with a lavish frontispiece that frames not only the beginning of the first treatise, <em>Expositio manus</em>, but also a beautifully executed portrait miniature, presumed to be of Tinctoris himself (<a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure81" href="#Figure81">Figure 8.1.</a><span id="Figure81" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-1.jpg" alt="Universitat de València, Biblioteca Històrica, MS 835, fol. 2r: frontispiece (detail).

The importance of the escutcheon to the history of the manuscript has recently been brought into the foreground by Ronald Woodley, publishing evidence in 2013 that <strong>V</strong> must have been completed ‘between the last few months of 1477 and the first few of 1478’, thereby establishing it as the ‘earliest datable source for the main corpus of Tinctoris’s pedagogical treatises’.<a href="notes.html#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">3</a> The establishment of the earliest source in a textual tradition is unarguably a matter of significance, especially when the texts in question are among the most valuable witnesses to late fifteenth-century music theory. Attention will therefore be paid to the escutcheon in the earlier stages of the present article, before the discussion is broadened to include the portrait miniature and other aspects of <strong>V</strong>’s production and later history. </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-3">[3]</span>Before addressing Woodley’s 2013 findings, it will be profitable briefly to survey the previous commentary on the escutcheon in question. The librarian and bibliographer Marcelino Gutiérrez del Caño (1861–1922) noted in his 1913 catalogue of manuscripts in Valencia’s university library that the <strong>V</strong> escutcheon is that of the sovereigns of Naples, supported by four angels (<em>ángeles</em>) or <em>putti</em>.<a href="notes.html#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">4</a> The Neapolitan bibliographer Tammaro De Marinis, in his magisterial mid-twentieth-century study of the library of the Aragonese kings of Naples, categorized the escutcheon as number 15 (<a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure84" href="#Figure84">Figure 8.4.</a><span id="Figure84" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-4.jpg" alt="De Marinis’s Aragonese escutcheon Type 15.

De Marinis observed nineteen types of Aragonese coats of arms in codices of the period 1442–1500, of which Types 10–15 are arms of King Ferrante I, for whom he concluded <strong>V</strong> must have been prepared.<a href="notes.html#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">5</a> In 1997, the Dresden-based manuscript librarian Thomas Haffner published a study of the library of King Ferrante’s son, Giovanni of Aragon (1456–85), that includes a catalogue-type entry on <strong>V</strong>.<a href="notes.html#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">6</a> He described the arms as a <em>Roßstirnschild</em>, or horse-head shield,<a href="notes.html#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">7</a> with three red pales in fields 1 and 4, surmounted by a brown-golden lily-crown. Haffner noticed that the area of blue around the crown shows signs of overpainting, adding that the arms of the upper <em>putti</em> seem somewhat distorted, as though they originally supported something other than the Aragonese arms, and proposed that the escutcheon originally was surmounted by a red cardinal’s hat, suggesting a dedication to Giovanni. Haffner nevertheless acknowledged that, even using special lighting, no outline of a hat may be seen today.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-4">[4]</span>Haffner’s discovery enabled Woodley to make the observation, first in 2005, that if <strong>V</strong> were made for Giovanni while he was a cardinal, then the manuscript must have been produced between his election as such in December 1477 and his death in October 1485.<a href="notes.html#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">8</a> Later, in 2013, Woodley proposed a significant revision to Haffner’s theory, observing that if there truly had been a cardinal’s red hat on the frontispiece before the overpainting, then one would expect there to have been ‘the incorporation of the red <em>fiocchi</em> or series of knotted tassels that conventionally hang down from either side of the hat’. Before Giovanni was created cardinal in December 1477, he held the position of prothonotary apostolic, therefore if <strong>V</strong> had been produced for him during this period, it could have been a grey prothonotary’s hat that was overpainted, as will be explored below. This led to the suggestion that <strong>V</strong> was completed in ‘a period between the last few months of 1477 and the first few of 1478’.<a href="notes.html#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">9</a> Woodley writes that ‘the case presented in [his] essay can hardly be regarded yet as definitive’, and accordingly it is intended here to explore further some of the relevant evidence. </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-5">[5]</span>The task of establishing a <em>terminus post quem</em> for <strong>V</strong> is relatively simple, since the manuscript includes the complete text of Tinctoris’s <em>De arte contrapuncti </em>on fols. 77<sup>v</sup>–144<sup>r</sup>. This treatise is dated on fol. 101<sup>r</sup> of <span class="siglum">B-Br II 4147</span> to 11 October 1477.<a href="notes.html#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">10</a> As Woodley observes, we may therefore be confident that <strong>V</strong> must have been completed after this date. That is not to say that production of the manuscript did not start before then, since many of the other texts had been completed during the previous few years. Indeed, as shall be seen, it is possible that the manuscript was completed very soon after this date.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-6">[6]</span>To establish a <em>terminus ante quem</em> is considerably more difficult, and currently hinges on Woodley’s plausible argument that we ought, according to convention, to expect red <em>fiocchi </em>t0<em> </em>hang down from either side of the hat if the manuscript were prepared for Giovanni during his cardinalate. The manner in which these tassels might have been incorporated into the design is exemplified in Woodley’s article using <span class="siglum">E-VAu 390</span>, which indeed features a cardinal’s red hat on the frontispiece, accompanied by the expected red <em>fiocchi</em> falling behind the escutcheon (<a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure85" href="#Figure85">Figure 8.5.</a><span id="Figure85" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-5.jpg" alt=" Valencia, Universitat de València, Biblioteca Histórica, MS 390 [olim 838], fol. 7r, frontispiece (detail).

Woodley also cites the example of <span class="siglum">F-R A 13</span>, a 1485 copy dedicated to Giovanni of Leonardo Nogarola’s <em>Tractatus de mundi eternitate</em> whose frontispiece (fol. 3<sup>r</sup>) also features the red cardinal’s hat (<a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure86" href="#Figure86">Figure 8.6.</a><span id="Figure86" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-6.jpg" alt=" Rouen, Bibliothèque municipale, MS A 13, Leonardo Nogarola’s Tractatus de mundi eternitate, fol. 3r (detail).

<p><span class="para-no" id="para-7">[7]</span>The overpainting above the escutcheon on the frontispiece of <strong>V</strong>, notes Woodley, ‘is restricted to the immediate area of the crown, perhaps with a little re-contouring or touching-up of the <em>putti</em>’s rearmost arms’. He reports that there are no signs of ‘interference or repainting’ in the decorative gold ribbons that hang to either side of the escutcheon, falling behind the <em>putti</em>, apart from a small, possibly accidental ‘patch’ of repainting ‘between the arms of the upper right <em>putto</em>’.<a href="notes.html#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">11</a> Woodley also points out that there is slight coloration of the verso of the repainted area behind the crown, which ‘is of a greyish hue, similar to that corresponding to the predominantly grey and blue tones of the second and third quarters of the arms’. This is in contrast, he says, to the ‘leaching of the red pigment from the ground of the red and gold Aragonese <em>pali</em>, and from the <em>putti</em>’s wings’.<a href="notes.html#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">12</a> This grey hue leads Woodley to propose that the artist painted over a grey prothonotary’s hat, which would have been Giovanni’s heraldic emblem between becoming apostolic prothonotary on 12 July 1465, at the age of nine, and becoming cardinal in December 1477. Given as examples of the use of the prothonotary’s hat are the frontispieces of <em>E-VAu</em> 847 (fol. 2<sup>r</sup>, <a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure87" href="#Figure87">Figure 8.7.</a><span id="Figure87" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-7.jpg" alt="Valencia, Universitat de València, Biblioteca Histórica, MS 847 [olim 770], Thomas Aquinas: De ente et essentia, c.1472, fol. 2r (detail).

<p><span class="para-no" id="para-8">[8]</span>Woodley states that ‘returning once again to the show-through on fol. 2 verso of <strong>V</strong>, it is not impossible to discern a slight contour in the staining of the overpainted area above the escutcheon that might well indicate the ghost of the shape of … a prothonotary’s hat, and the colouring of the stain is certainly at least consistent with the notion that this could indeed have been the underlying depiction.’ I had the opportunity to visit the manuscript in Valencia in 2014, and on physical inspection of fol. 2<sup>v</sup>, the contour Woodley describes is indeed visible. Using only ambient transmitted and reflected light, gently manipulating the parchment while looking at the verso from certain angles, it is indeed possible to see much more distinctly the shape of the prothonotary’s hat to which Woodley refers.<a href="notes.html#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">14</a></p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-9">[9]</span>It seems that none or very little of the original paint remains beneath the surface of the newer layer, since torchlight transmitted from the verso and viewed from the recto, or vice versa, reveals the same shape of the prothonotary’s hat, owing to the overpainter having scratched away the surface of the parchment. If there were a residual layer of paint beneath the surface of the overpainting then it would be expected to interfere with the transmission of light. The faint yet seemingly dark shape of the hat noticed by Woodley on the verso is most likely a discoloration caused by the particular pigment used to paint the hat, which has permeated the parchment and hence avoided being scratched away.<a href="notes.html#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15">15</a> It is just possible to see dark lines where the golden bands originally were attached to the prothonotary’s hat, which indicates they were simply overpainted rather than scratched away first. </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-10">[10]</span>Discoloured patches on the obverse of quarters 2 and 3 of the escutcheon suggest that the hat was painted with the same or a similar pigment. On first-hand visual inspection using torchlight and 10 × magnification, the fields of the leftmost and rightmost sectors of quarters 2 and 3, which appear in <a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure83" href="#Figure83">Figure 8.3.</a><span id="Figure83" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-3.jpg" alt="Universitat de València, Biblioteca Històrica, MS 835 [olim 844], fol. 2r: frontispiece (detail).

Likewise, the light silver pales and the gold fleurs-de-lys, not to mention the gold crown, shine brightly under illumination and magnification. Physical inspection, therefore, would seem to corroborate Woodley’s findings, on the basis of which it would seem likely that Giovanni was indeed the commissioner and/or dedicatee of<strong> V</strong>, and that the manuscript was finished between the completion of <em>De arte contrapuncti </em>on 11 October 1477 and sometime shortly after Giovanni became cardinal, perhaps in the first few months of 1478. </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-11">[11]</span>It has been possible to examine at first-hand another manuscript from Giovanni’s collection which features an escutcheon bearing the Aragonese arms – <span class="siglum">GB-Lbl Harley 3485</span>, a 1470 Florentine manuscript copy of Plutarch’s <em>Lives</em>.<a href="notes.html#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16">16</a> The manuscript is identifiable as having been prepared for Giovanni on account of the inscription ‘card<em>en</em>ale’ on the front flyleaf.<a href="notes.html#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17">17</a> The escutcheon is surmounted by a five-point lily crown, just as in <strong>V</strong>, though in <span class="siglum">GB-Lbl Harley 3485</span> the crown is somewhat ill-defined; the execution bears none of the subtlety of the rest of the decoration. It is enclosed in a dark blue circle, the pigment of which is less vibrant than that of the surrounding Florentine hybrid <em>bianchi girari</em> decoration, which is attributable to Mariano del Buono (c.1433–1504).<a href="notes.html#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18">18</a> There is a gold band around the blue circle within a laurel wreath that is supported by four <em>putti</em>. It would appear that, just as Haffner and Woodley suggest in the case of <strong>V</strong>, the same dark shape of the prothonotary’s hat as in <strong>V</strong> is very definitely visible on the verso of the frontispiece of <span class="siglum">GB-Lbl Harley 3485</span> (fol. 3), using transmitted light, and there is bleed-through onto the verso of the pigment used for the hat that is visible even without transmitted light.<a href="notes.html#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">19</a> The bleed-through is of the same shade and intensity as that created by the painting of quarters 1 and 4 of the Aragonese arms, which is rendered in a half-rounded escutcheon. In the miniature to the right of the escutcheon, which depicts Eumenes of Cardia, dressed in green, being strangled by one of his guards, dressed in red, the bars of the prison are executed in the same pigment as the prothonotary’s hat. This is shown by a perfect match between the shade and intensity of the bleed-though. Using torchlight transmitted from the verso to the recto, it is possible to observe a greater degree of increase in opacity in the undisturbed black pigment of the prison bars than in the partially erased and overpainted prothonotary’s hat.</p>

These bands must have been heraldically appropriate to the original symbol, yet they do not appear to be appropriate to the prothonotary’s hat. There are eighteen extant manuscripts and incunabula from Giovanni’s library that still feature, or can be said confidently to have once featured, a prothonotary’s hat.

It would seem, therefore, there are no known examples of either a prothonotary’s or a cardinal’s hat being associated with hanging golden bands such as are seen on the frontispiece of <strong>V</strong>. This could be interpreted as an indication that some other heraldic device was originally painted there. </p><h3><a id="_Toc434897580"></a>Dating the Manuscript: Other Potential Recipients</h3><p><span class="para-no" id="para-20">[20]</span>After providing examples of those manuscripts that clearly show the red cardinal’s hat having been overpainted and erased, Woodley considers the possibility that other heraldic devices might have been placed above the escutcheon in <strong>V</strong>. He discounts Ferrante’s daughter, Beatrice, and focuses instead on his son Alfonso (1448–95), Duke of Calabria, later King Alfonso II after Ferrante I’s death in 1494, some of whose manuscripts feature the ducal coronet as a heraldic device. Since Alfonso was ‘a particularly energetic and generous cultural patron, with credentials for, and apparently genuine personal interests in, the support of the Neapolitan court’s literary, artistic and architectural ambitions’,<a href="notes.html#footnote-43" id="footnote-ref-43">43</a> Woodley sees him as a perfectly viable, indeed attractive, candidate as commissioner of <strong>V</strong>, especially given the two <em>elogia</em> by Frater Fortunatus Ferrariensis, a monk of the Olivetan order, which appear on fols. 1<sup>v</sup> and 164<sup>r</sup> of the manuscript. Indeed, Alfonso could convincingly be linked with the Olivetan order through his association with the church of S. Maria de Monteoliveto (now S. Anna dei Lombardi).<a href="notes.html#footnote-44" id="footnote-ref-44">44</a> Woodley asserts, however, that his analysis of manuscripts associated with Alfonso, which are reproduced in De Marinis’s and Toscano’s publications, shows that ‘the coronet was depicted only in association with the personal arms of the Duke of Calabria, quartered into Aragonese pali (2 and 3, or 1 and 4) and large cross of Jerusalem on a grey ground (1 and 4, or 2 and 3 respectively)’, and therefore that Alfonso probably was not the commissioner of<strong> V</strong>.<a href="notes.html#footnote-45" id="footnote-ref-45">45</a> He states that ‘if future research … can demonstrate that Alfonso’s arms, while he was Duke of Calabria, did sometimes combine the coronet with the full Aragonese escutcheon as seen in <strong>V</strong>, as an alternative to the escutcheon proper to the Dukedom, the question of attribution to him rather than Giovanni should certainly be reopened’.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-21">[21]</span>There are thirteen extant manuscripts that may be associated with Alfonso, none of which features the full Aragonese arms in combination with the coronet; these are detailed in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="file:///C:\Users\ID123124\Dropbox\Birmingham%20Conservatoire\Brepols%20volume\Web%20Version\Web-Ready%20Chapters\Goursaud\table8-1.html" target="_blank">Table 8.1</a>. On this basis, it is tempting to conclude, like Woodley, that the only viable candidate for the commissioner of<strong> V</strong> is Giovanni. However, one possible scenario exists that could provide a narrative for an ascription of <strong>V</strong> to Alfonso. The pigments used for the escutcheon bearing the Aragonese arms, and the lily crown that surmounts it, look more vibrant than many areas of the rest of the frontispiece, and the execution is certainly more vivid and bold than the delicate rendering of the <em>putti</em>. This could be explained simply by the effect of the use of gold and the obvious difference in priority when the artist or artists were engaged in figurative as opposed to heraldic decoration. But given the fact that we may be almost certain that some overpainting of the surmounting occurred, it is not too fanciful at least to consider the possibility that the escutcheon was also overpainted, perhaps in preparation for, or after, Alfonso’s coronation as King of Naples on 8 May 1494. If the manuscript had been prepared in the few years following Tinctoris’s completion of <em>Liber de arte contrapuncti </em>on 11 October 1477 and then adjusted some 17 years later, this could easily account for the difference in vibrancy and vividness of the potentially refashioned areas. In this scenario, the arms of the Duke of Calabria on a horse-head escutcheon were painted initially, surmounted by a ducal coronet, as in <em>E-VAu</em> 55 (<a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure816" href="#Figure816">Figure 8.16</a><span id="Figure816" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-16.jpg" alt="Valencia, Universitat de València, Biblioteca Histórica, MS 55 [olim 848], fol. 1r (detail).

There are, however, several problems with this theory. In Alfonso’s collection of books, there do not seem to be any examples of similar adjustments, unlike in Giovanni’s rather larger collection. It is curious that no manuscripts of Alfonso’s survive from 1488 until his coronation in 1494; this could have been related to the political and economic disturbances of the late 1480s, which included the 1486 barons’ revolt. Until such a time as scientific methods of profiling individual pigments are available to be deployed on location in Valencia at a manageable cost, however, there is simply not enough evidence to prove the validity of this theory. At the current time the evidence still points to Giovanni as the codex’s probable commissioner.</p><h3>Dating the Manuscript: Scribal Speed</h3><p><span class="para-no" id="para-22">[22]</span>If <strong>V</strong> was indeed commissioned, planned, and had begun to be manufactured soon after or some time before the completion of Tinctoris’s treatise <em>De arte contrapuncti</em> in October 1477, ‘destined primarily for the collection of Giovanni d’Aragona while he was still prothonotary apostolic’,<a href="notes.html#footnote-46" id="footnote-ref-46">46</a> then it would be of relevance to consider how rapid the scribal process may have been. Despite the scholarly consensus that <strong>V</strong> was copied by Venceslaus Crispus, however, there are insufficient documentary records to allow direct analysis of the speed of his individual practice.<a href="notes.html#footnote-47" id="footnote-ref-47">47</a> Indeed, there is in general little surviving evidence from which timeframes for jobs of scribal work may be inferred.<a href="notes.html#footnote-48" id="footnote-ref-48">48</a> It is possible, however, and instructive, to consider some examples where some data concerning scribal speed may be gathered in relation to manuscripts produced for Giovanni of Aragon.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-23">[23]</span>We may learn much from one codex in particular – the Drouot Aquinas manuscript, one of two Neapolitan copies of the works of Thomas Aquinas – in this case <em>Catena aurea super Iohannem</em> – currently in private hands.<a href="notes.html#footnote-49" id="footnote-ref-49">49</a> This manuscript is written in gothic rotunda, of which script Crispus was by far the most prevalent practitioner at Naples. Indeed, the Drouot Aquinas manuscript forms part of a major collection of the works of Aquinas that was prepared for Giovanni, principally by Crispus himself. In this case, however, we are presented with the only extant manuscript to have been executed by the Flemish scribe Johannes de Guerne.<a href="notes.html#footnote-50" id="footnote-ref-50">50</a> The codex’s unusually long and informative colophon confirms that it was written in Naples and completed there on 18 November 1486 by De Guerne at the expense of Cardinal Giovanni. It also reveals that Giovanni had been sent by King Ferrante to Pope Innocent VIII in Rome, in order to appeal for assistance in the Aragonese war against the rebellious local barons:<a href="notes.html#footnote-51" id="footnote-ref-51">51</a></p><table><tr><td><p class="doubleColumnDisplayedText">Beati Thome Aquinatis continuum in duos evangelistas per me Johannem de Guerne Flamingum, exscriptum finitumque Neapoli regnante felicissimo rege Ferdinando, anno Domini natalis millesimo quatercentesimo octogesimo sexto, decimo octavo die novembris, sumptu illustrissimi Domini Joannis de Aragonia eiusdem Ferdinandi regis filii, sancte romanae ecclesie cardinalis presbiteri, qui dum Romam a patre ad pontificem maximum missus esset vitam cum morte finivit dicto millesimo anno LXXXV mense septembris.<a href="notes.html#footnote-52" id="footnote-ref-52">52</a></p></td><td><p class="doubleColumnDisplayedText">Blessed Thomas Aquinas, ‘Commentary on the Two Evangelists’, written and completed by me Johannes de Guerne, Fleming, at Naples, in the reign of the most felicitous King Ferrante, in the year of our Lord’s birth one thousand four hundred and eighty-six, om the eighteenth day of November, at the expense of the most illustrious Lord Giovanni of Aragon, son of the same King Ferrante, Cardinal priest of the Holy Roman Church, whose life ended with death while having been sent to Rome, to the Supreme Pontiff, by his father, in the said eighty-fifth milennial year, in the month of September. </p></td></tr></table><p><span class="para-no" id="para-24">[24]</span>Giovanni died not in September, as related by De Guerne, but on 17 October 1485, at the age of twenty-nine, when he said either to have fallen victim to the plague or to have been poisoned.<a href="notes.html#footnote-53" id="footnote-ref-53">53</a> He must therefore have commissioned the Drouot Aquinas manuscript in the months leading up to his death.

On this basis, if <strong>V</strong> were completed between the last few months of 1477 and the first few of 1478 then it could be expected to have been commissioned between August 1476 and February 1477. However, De Guerne was nowhere near as prolific a scribe as Crispus, and it could be inferred that Crispus was given so much work precisely because he was able to work quickly. </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-25">[25]</span>It is possible to learn that scribal speed was something of which to be proud from the case of Joanmarco Cinico, who worked in a fine humanistic script, was a pupil of the Florentine scribe Pietro Strozzi (b. 1416), and was a correspondent and evidently a friend of Tinctoris’s.<a href="notes.html#footnote-55" id="footnote-ref-55">55</a> Cinico was renowned for his speed of copying and came to describe himself as ‘Velox’, which first appears in <span class="siglum">E-VAu 781</span>, a 1468 copy of Pontano’s <em>De Principe</em>, wherein he describes himself as Joannes M. Velox Parmensis.<a href="notes.html#footnote-56" id="footnote-ref-56">56</a> In the colophon to his 1465 copy of Pliny’s <em>Historia naturalis</em> (<span class="siglum">I-Nn V.I.3</span>), Cinico relates that he completed the copying of its 635 folios in 120 days – a rate of five folios per day.<a href="notes.html#footnote-57" id="footnote-ref-57">57</a> He completed his copy of Facio’s <em>De humanae vitae felicitate dialogus</em> (<span class="siglum">I-Fl Strozz. 109</span>) in fifty-two hours, and the thirty-six or thirty‑eight folios of his copy of Albertus Magnus’s <em>Arte di ben morire</em> in fifty-three hours.<a href="notes.html#footnote-58" id="footnote-ref-58">58</a> These examples, however, clearly represent the upper limits of scribal rapidity.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-26">[26]</span>In addition to the probability that Crispus worked more quickly than De Guerne, the Drouot Aquinas manuscript is in several senses significantly larger than <strong>V</strong>, and hence would have taken longer to produce even at the same rate of work. Its parchment folios measure 370 × 263 mm as opposed to <strong>V</strong>’s 272 × 190 mm, while the dimensions of the writing block are respectively 232 × 153 mm and 172 × 105 mm, and the Drouot Aquinas manuscript consists of 181 folios, which is slightly more than the 164 of<strong> V</strong>. At this stage, therefore, the estimate for the total production time of<strong> V</strong> might be reduced from twenty months to between twelve and fifteen months, bringing the estimated date of commission to late 1476.</p>

It is notable that Crispus received four separate payments for quaterns and quinterns, and that the number of quires in each payment for quinterns was even and consistent. This suggests methodical planning of which size of quire to use, and potentially an order of execution that followed not the order of the text, but an order dictated by the planned physical structure of the manuscript.<a href="notes.html#footnote-63" id="footnote-ref-63">63</a> These records also demonstrate that separate quires were submitted by Neapolitan scribes to the library, where they were perhaps proof-read and otherwise checked centrally before being bound together.

The <em>Liber de natura et proprietate tonorum</em> is dated in <span class="siglum">B-Br II 4147 Mus.</span>, on fol. 28<sup>r</sup>, as having been completed on 6 November 1476. There is only one case in <strong>V</strong> where an individual treatise was copied into a discrete group of quires (<em>Expositio manus</em> into quires 1 and 2), and the rest of the works are seemingly copied in sequence, beginning with the <em>Liber de natura et proprietate tonorum</em>. Therefore, if the manuscript was indeed prepared for Giovanni, and was completed in December 1477, necessitating the adjustment from the prothonotary’s hat to the five-pointed lily crown after the news of his cardinalate broke, then the copying of the manuscript will have begun no earlier than November 1476. This would fit with a twelve- to fifteen-month estimate for the total production time for the manuscript. If the contrary evidence presented above concerning the horse-head escutcheon means that the dating of the manuscript is as late as 1483–4, then the production of the manuscript would have been started in 1482 or 1483. </p><h3>Dating the Manuscript: The Lily Crown</h3><p><span class="para-no" id="para-31">[31]</span>Why was the adjustment on the frontispiece of <strong>V</strong> made from the prothonotary’s hat to the lily crown rather than to the cardinal’s hat, if it occurred as a reaction to the news of Giovanni’s cardinalate? In order to provide some context for this, a brief digression to consider the incunable <span class="siglum">GB-Gu Hunterian By. 2. 3</span> is necessary. This copy of Duns Scotus’s <em>Questiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi</em>, is dated 26 July 1477, more than four months before the consistory that made Giovanni cardinal.<a href="notes.html#footnote-64" id="footnote-ref-64">64</a> It was edited by Thomas Penketh and Bartholomaeus Bellatus, and printed in Venice by Johannes de Colonia and Johannes Manthen de Gherretzem. Its frontispiece features the full Aragonese arms surmounted by what appears to be a cardinal’s hat including tassels.<a href="notes.html#footnote-65" id="footnote-ref-65">65</a> It seems perfectly reasonable to suppose that by the time the book had been sold to Giovanni and he had sent it to be decorated in Naples, his creation as cardinal had been announced, that being a period of only a few months. What is perplexing, however, is that, like the wings of the two supporting <em>putti</em>, the hat appears to be painted in a combination of red and silver rather than the pure red one would expect. Silver paint tarnishes with time, indeed Julie Gardham, Senior Assistant Librarian at the University of Glasgow Library, has written of this frontispiece that ‘the silver has oxidised and tarnished over the years to a greyish black that does not reflect its original brilliance’.<a href="notes.html#footnote-66" id="footnote-ref-66">66</a> This does not, however, explain the use of silver pigment in the first place. It is possible that the manuscript was purchased and the decoration begun before 10 December, silver was initially used to render the prothonotary’s hat, and then an attempt at overpainting was made using red paint, which was unsuccessful, forcing the artist (possibly Matteo Felice) to extend the not-unattractive, but heraldically dubious combination of silver and red to the rest of the emblem and <em>putti</em>.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-32">[32]</span>Whichever of these possibilities was in fact the case for <em>GB-Gu</em> Hunterian By.2.3, considering the problem does raise important questions for the history of<strong> V</strong>. Woodley writes that <strong>V</strong> ‘must have been commissioned, planned in both principle and detail, and its execution commenced, very soon after – or even, indeed, some time before – the completion of the counterpoint treatise in October 1477, destined primarily for the collection of Giovanni d’Aragona while he was still prothonotary apostolic. Then, at some point after news of the cardinalate broke – it is simply not possible to say how soon or long after – the heraldic inaccuracy led to the alterations that we see in the manuscript today.’<a href="notes.html#footnote-67" id="footnote-ref-67">67</a> But if the alteration was made in 1477 or 1478 rather than after Giovanni’s death in 1485, why was the alteration made to a five-pointed lily crown rather than to a red cardinal’s hat? An example of a manuscript where the lily crown is used as an alternative to the prothonotary’s hat is <span class="siglum">D-B lat. fol. 28</span> (fol. 1<sup>r</sup>, <a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure817" href="#Figure817">Figure 8.17</a><span id="Figure817" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-17.jpg" alt="Berlin, Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin Preußischer Kulturbesitz, MS lat. fol. 28, fol. 1r.

It is a copy of Suetonius, <em>De vita XII Caesarum</em> and <em>De grammaticis et rhetoribus</em> that was dated 25 June 1477 at Naples, and hence was completed just a month before <span class="siglum">GB-Gu Hunterian By.2.3</span> was printed. Alternatively, it is possible that <strong>V</strong> was transferred to Ferrante’s library upon Giovanni’s election as a cardinal.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-33">[33]</span>Woodley states that ‘other manuscripts attest to [the use of the lily crown] by Giovanni as a valid alternative’ to the cardinal’s hat. I have found three manuscripts that support this statement strongly, first by being securely dated in their texts to after Giovanni’s cardinalate, and second by bearing no sign of overpainting, thereby suggesting that the lily crown was indeed used originally as a true alternative to the cardinal’s hat. <span class="siglum">CH-Bgünther s.n.</span> (<a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure818" href="#Figure818">Figure 8.18</a><span id="Figure818" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-18.jpg" alt="Basel, Dr Jörn Günther Antiquariats und Verwaltungs AG, fol. 1r (detail).

The example of <span class="siglum">GB-Gu Hunterian By.2.3</span> suggests that it is possible that there were indeed short-notice adjustments being made to Giovanni’s books at the time.</p><h3>The Portrait Miniature</h3><p><span class="para-no" id="para-34">[34]</span>On the frontispiece of <strong>V</strong>, a figure is shown sitting at a desk, reading musical notation from an open book.<a href="notes.html#footnote-69" id="footnote-ref-69">69</a> He is depicted in a small room, perhaps a <em>loggia</em> or <em>studiolo </em>in the Neapolitan Castelnuovo, with arched windows looking out over a view with an ornate wall in the foreground, followed by several topiaried trees, the spires and towers of buildings, and a background of hills and sky rendered delicately in blue. He wears a purple robe, a blue undergarment and footwear, and a darker-blue hat. Can we safely assume that this miniature is a portrait of Tinctoris, the author of the texts that it accompanies? If the figure were explicitly presented as being in the process of writing then there would be no question that it represented the author, but no writing implements are in view. Some fifteenth-century manuscripts feature portrait miniatures of their dedicatee or commissioner rather than the author of their text(s), so the following discussion will weigh the evidence for and against the identification of Tinctoris on the frontispiece of <strong>V</strong>. </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-35">[35]</span>Tinctoris tells us in the Prologue to <em>De arte contrapuncti</em>, speaking of the works of Okeghem, Busnoys, Du Fay and others, that ‘I never hear, never study them without coming away happier and more learned.’<a href="notes.html#footnote-70" id="footnote-ref-70">70</a> As Rob Wegman has noted, Tinctoris gives evidence here that <em>studying</em> as well as hearing music was for him a meaningful mode of engagement, and we might therefore feel comfortable with the theorist depicted as not writing, neither singing nor playing an instrument, but rather silently examining the music in front of him.<a href="notes.html#footnote-71" id="footnote-ref-71">71</a></p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-36">[36]</span>Before engaging in more depth with the detail of this specific miniature, it will be placed in the context of other iconographically similar miniatures included on the frontispieces of manuscripts that can be shown to originate in Naples in the second half of the fifteenth century. Twenty examples are extant, of which sixteen may confidently be described as portraits (or pseudo-portraits) of the author of the text, since those men, all of whom were long dead at the time of painting, are identified as the authors of their theological texts by having tonsured heads and specific types of monastic habit, for example Thomas Aquinas in <span class="siglum">F-LO 7</span> (fol. 7<sup>r</sup>, &lt;**<span class="figno">Figure 8.20[8-20.jpg]</span>Louviers, Médiathèque Boris Vian (formerly Bibliothèque municipale), MS 7, fol. 7<sup>r</sup> (detail).

The humanist scholar Lorenzo Valla died in 1457, around fifteen years before <span class="siglum">E-VAu 408</span>, a copy of his <em>Elegantiae latinae linguae</em>, was completed. He worked at the court of Ferrante I’s predecessor, King Alfonso, to whom he was private Latin secretary.

<p><span class="para-no" id="para-39">[39]</span>How might the fact be accounted for that these four individuals – Gellius the second-century scholar, Vincent the thirteenth-century Dominican friar, Valla the earlier fifteenth-century humanist, and Tinctoris the later fifteenth-century music theorist – are all dressed in ostensibly similar court robes? There was clearly an effort on the part of those who planned and executed the manuscripts to align the works of fifteenth-century Neapolitan erudites like Tinctoris and Valla with great authors of medieval and classical texts. <em>Noctes atticae</em> comprises a sequence of notes, quotations and ruminations on many and various classical texts, and indeed personal recollections written during the long winter nights spent by Gellius in Athens, and was supposedly compiled for the edification and education of his children. Vincent of Beauvais’s <em>Speculum historiale </em>is a world history of great length: <span class="siglum">E-VAu 381</span> runs to 300 folios and comprises only books 17–21. It includes a great deal of secular as well as sacred history, and features extracts from Cicero, Ovid, Chrysostom, Augustine, and Jerome. Robert Ralph Bolgar described Valla’s <em>Elegantiae latinae linguae</em> as ‘the Bible of the later Humanists’,<a href="notes.html#footnote-73" id="footnote-ref-73">73</a> which attests to its significance as a critical examination of Latin grammar, style and rhetoric. <span class="siglum">E-VAu 408</span> was produced in the early 1470s, just after Valla’s work had been printed and had begun to circulate in large numbers. </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-40">[40]</span>If it can be considered likely that the <strong>V</strong> miniature was intended to represent Tinctoris, a consequent question is to what extent we might expect the portrait to be a realistic likeness of him. In order to understand something of the climate within which the artist was working and what his priorities may have been, comparison will be made of several contemporary representations of King Ferrante, surely one of the more recognisable individuals in later fifteenth-century Naples, and dedicatee of Johannes Tinctoris’s <em>Missa [secundi toni irregularis]</em>.<a href="notes.html#footnote-74" id="footnote-ref-74">74</a></p>

<p><span class="para-no" id="para-45">[45]</span>The evidence so far discussed would suggest that there were often successful attempts at realistic portraiture in Nardo’s work and in the work of the Neapolitan miniaturists in general. Though this was not always the case, generic representations of heads and facial features tend to be recognisable by a more rounded and less detailed execution that is visible in the non-featured characters in many of the examples of miniatures given so far and later in this chapter. In <strong>V</strong>, the figure has a delicately rendered ‘button nose’, a slight chin and brow, with fairly deep-set eyes. The tuft of hair at the base of the rear of his hat rather suggests that the hat is worn tightly and is holding in a generous quantity of thick hair. In short, I believe that it is likely that we are looking at a well-defined representation as opposed to a generic one, and hence that we are indeed presented with a likeness of Tinctoris himself. The compiler of a sixteenth-century inventory of books including <strong>V</strong> apparently agreed (see <a href="#para-86">para. 86</a> below).<a href="notes.html#footnote-80" id="footnote-ref-80">80</a></p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-46">[46]</span>In interpreting the significance or otherwise of the robes worn by Tinctoris in the <strong>V</strong> miniature, an important documentary reference to consider is an entry in the Neapolitan <em>Cedole di tesoreria</em> of 25 October 1480.<a href="notes.html#footnote-81" id="footnote-ref-81">81</a> This chapel wardrobe account quite remarkably mentions Tinctoris by name, specifying a payment made to him in cloth (such a distribution to courtiers is very common in the <em>Cedole</em>): ‘A Ioan Tintoris. Firenza paonaczo de grana sbagnato. canna 3 pal. 6.’<a href="notes.html#footnote-82" id="footnote-ref-82">82</a> It is immediately evident that this refers to Florentine cloth, but what of <em>paonaczo de grana sbagnato</em>? </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-47">[47]</span>Scholarly opinion is divided as to whether the term <em>paonaczo</em> (variant spellings include <em>pavonazzo</em>, <em>paonazzo</em>, <em>paonazo</em>, <em>pagonazzo</em>, <em>paonaczo</em>, and <em>paonacza</em>) may have referred specifically to the ‘deep, rich blue-violet’ colouring of the body of the peacock (<em>pavone</em>), or that of the peahen, ‘a brownish tint of red’.<a href="notes.html#footnote-83" id="footnote-ref-83">83</a> It would therefore seem likely that the term could describe a range of colours between blue and red. Evidence for this is provided by records that use the term in conjunction with qualifiers to describe the particular shade of <em>pavonazzo</em>. A quantity of <em>zambelotto</em> (a plain woollen cloth) <em>pavonazzo</em>, which was given in 1504 to the Venetian <em>Signoria</em> by the sultan of Turkey, was described as ‘piu scuro’ than another, while in the same consignment was ‘paonazo con fojani turchini’, which presumably featured a pattern of leaves in a Turkish style.<a href="notes.html#footnote-84" id="footnote-ref-84">84</a> The late fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century Venetian historian Marin Sanudo recorded the price of ‘paonazzo morello’,<a href="notes.html#footnote-85" id="footnote-ref-85">85</a> thereby demonstrating quite clearly the potential for variant shades, while the prolific Venetian writer Lodovico Dolce (1508–68), in his 1565 <em>Dialogo dei colori</em>, linked <em>pavonazzo</em> more specifically to ‘purpura violata’.<a href="notes.html#footnote-86" id="footnote-ref-86">86</a> Stella Mary Newton writes that a bearded man in Titian’s <em>Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple</em> is probably wearing <em>pavonazzo</em> velvet (<a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure835" href="#Figure835">Figure 8.35</a><span id="Figure835" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-35.jpg" alt="Titian: Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple.

<p><span class="para-no" id="para-48">[48]</span>A convincing interpretation of the reasons behind the confusion over the definition of <em>pavonazzo</em> is advanced by Jacqueline Herald.<a href="notes.html#footnote-89" id="footnote-ref-89">89</a> In 1464, Pope Paul II declared the dyestuff known as ‘<em>chermisi</em>’ to be ‘<em>purpura cardinalizia</em>’ (the cardinals’ purple). <em>Chermisi</em> (crimson, similarly derived from the Greek <em>kermes</em>) was, however, a high-quality <em>red</em> dye, imported from the East, which produced a red tending towards the orange end of the spectrum, and was used for silk velvets and wool.<a href="notes.html#footnote-90" id="footnote-ref-90">90</a> Herald attributes this inconsistency to the decline in the use of purple murex, ‘especially after the fall of Constantinople [in 1453], the last bastion of medieval purple dyeing’.<a href="notes.html#footnote-91" id="footnote-ref-91">91</a> If this is the case, the apparent imprecision of the terminology may be due to the fact that <em>pavonazzo </em>maintained its symbolic meaning(s), and continued to be made using high-quality dyes, while the actual colour changed, owing to the changing availability of dyestuffs and expertise. </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-49">[49]</span>The use of <em>chermisi</em> to make <em>pavonazzo</em> took place in both Florence and Venice, where it was known as <em>cremesino</em>. Though the regulations controlling the activities of dyers in Florence and Venice were largely similar, they did differ in that in Florence <em>pavonazzo</em> was also made using <em>grana</em>, a red dye that was less expensive than <em>chermisi</em>, and hence was considered inferior. Its name derives from the fact that it was made from mediterranean shield lice, whose dried bodies had the appearance of kernels of grain.<a href="notes.html#footnote-92" id="footnote-ref-92">92</a> Though it was less highly prized than <em>chermisi</em>, <em>grana</em> still made valuable cloth. Indeed, ‘The most expensive woollens imported into Rome – those dyed with <em>grana</em> – were almost exclusively of Florentine origin. A bolt of wool cloth dyed with <em>grana</em> fetched the considerable price of 70 florins, whereas a bolt without grana sold for between 27 and 45 florins.’<a href="notes.html#footnote-93" id="footnote-ref-93">93</a></p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-50">[50]</span>The distribution of cloth to Tinctoris may therefore be understood to be washed (<em>sbagnato</em>) Florentine <em>pavonazzo</em> cloth dyed with <em>grana</em> – an expensive product that imparted a red colour. The changing shades of <em>pavonazzo</em> from purple to red during the fifteenth century, as described above, may provide an explanation for the fact that the robes we see Tinctoris wearing in the <strong>V</strong> miniature are of a more purple hue; if the priority of the artist was to portray him in the most favourable light, then the representation of his robes being of the older purple shade would be logical, even if the robes he was actually supplied with were of the newer, redder, cloth made with <em>grana</em> dye.<a href="notes.html#footnote-94" id="footnote-ref-94">94</a></p><h3>Artists and Miniaturists</h3><p><span class="para-no" id="para-51">[51]</span>Having considered some of the more general aspects of <strong>V</strong>’s portrait miniature, we now turn to consider those artists who were responsible for decorating this music-theory manuscript in such a manner as to place it aesthetically amongst the most prized of late fifteenth-century Neapolitan royal books. The following brief assessment of the secondary literature is offered as an introduction to the ensuing discussion.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-52">[52]</span>Tammaro De Marinis attributed the painting of the portrait miniature on the frontispiece of <strong>V</strong> to the Neapolitan artist Cristoforo Majorana.<a href="notes.html#footnote-95" id="footnote-ref-95">95</a> Leeman L. Perkins subsequently adopted De Marinis’s attribution and attempted to substantiate the case by way of comparison with a similar portrait miniature (fol. 1<sup>r</sup>; see Figure 8.25 above) on the frontispiece of <span class="siglum">E-VAu 389</span> ‘for which there are records of payment to Majorana’.<a href="notes.html#footnote-96" id="footnote-ref-96">96</a> Perkins asserted that ‘Gellius is clad in a robe of the same mauve color as that worn by Tinctoris’, that he ‘is seated in a similar attitude at a small table that forms like angles with chair and walls, and he is discovered on a closed terrace that is very much the same with the opening to the sea divided by columns into three arched bays, the wall surface below done in a series of recessed panels, the floor tiled in contrasting colours, and the same curtained opening giving to the left’. Furthermore, he ventured that ‘a significant resemblance is also discernible in the ornamental cornice crowning the page and in the position, expression, and general appearance of the <em>putti</em> supporting the Aragonese escutcheon below’.<a href="notes.html#footnote-97" id="footnote-ref-97">97</a> Finally, Perkins ascribed the secondary decoration of V – the foliate borderwork and painted initials – to the atelier of Matteo Felice, on the basis of similarities with the decoration of the Neapolitan Aquinas manuscripts <span class="siglum">F-Pn lat. 495</span>, <span class="siglum">F-Pn lat. 674</span>, and <span class="siglum">F-Pn lat. 6525</span>. Then, in 1982, Ronald Woodley asserted a revision, on the advice of Albinia de la Mare, to Perkins’s attribution of the portrait miniature of <strong>V</strong> to Cristoforo Majorana. The <em>putti </em>on the frontispiece of this manuscript, we learned, were unmistakably the work of Cola Rapicano.<a href="notes.html#footnote-98" id="footnote-ref-98">98</a> </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-53">[53]</span>Gennaro Toscano has subsequently re-attributed the painting of the frontispiece of <strong>V</strong> to Nardo Rapicano, who was active at Naples during the last quarter of the fifteenth century.<a href="notes.html#footnote-99" id="footnote-ref-99">99</a> He was presumably either the son or the brother of Cola Rapicano, after whose death we find the first records of payments to Nardo in his own name.<a href="notes.html#footnote-100" id="footnote-ref-100">100</a> In order to engage with this attribution, it is necessary first to confront the fact that there is only one securely attributable example of the artist’s work: <span class="siglum">F-Pn ital. 1711</span>, the aforementioned copy by Giovan Matteo de Russis of Giuniano Maio’s <em>De maiestate</em>.<a href="notes.html#footnote-101" id="footnote-ref-101">101</a> The attribution is made possible by the following <em>Cedole</em> record of 2 April 1493:</p><table><tr><td><p class="doubleColumnDisplayedText">A Nardo Rapicano miniatore a di II de aprile 1493.

This and the other features described here suggest that the frontispiece of <strong>V</strong>, including the portrait miniature of Johannes Tinctoris, should indeed be considered to be the work of Nardo, not Cola, Rapicano.</p><h3>Secondary Decoration</h3><p><span class="para-no" id="para-58">[58]</span>There is undoubtedly a certain allure to the study of sumptuous frontispieces and to the interpretation of figurative and narrative miniatures. No less rewarding of attention, however, is the secondary decoration of such manuscripts as <strong>V</strong> – the various strategies employed to organize the textual content of the manuscript by visual means, and the stylistic aesthetics within and through which those strategies are deployed. The following discussion will focus first on the hierarchy of decorated initials in <strong>V</strong> as expressed by their respective size, the media used in their execution, and the extent of their marginal extension and elaboration, before proceeding to questions of artistic style attribution.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-59">[59]</span>In order to provide necessary context, the following analysis of the manner in which the content of <strong>V</strong> is structured by visual means will be achieved through comparisons with <strong>V</strong>’s sister manuscript <span class="siglum">I-Bu 2573</span> (hereafter <strong>BU</strong>). <strong>V</strong> and<strong> BU</strong> each contain the same nine treatises in the same order. <strong>V</strong> is the larger manuscript, each parchment folio measuring 272 × 190 mm, while<strong> BU</strong>’s folios are smaller at 235 × 168 mm, and consequently <strong>V</strong> runs to 164 and<strong> BU</strong> to 190 folios. This physical disparity means that the mise-en-page of each manuscript is different, and while they both articulate essentially the same textual content, that content is presented in subtly different ways. One of the most evident ways in which this finds expression is in the decorated initials, which are by far the most abundant type of visual decoration in each manuscript. These decorated initials, as with other manuscripts of the period, are organized in a hierarchy that reflects the structure of the texts presented, and imposes order on them in the eyes and mind of the reader. The nature of these music-theoretical texts, with Tinctoris’s characteristically exhaustive lists of intervals and proportions, results in a huge number of initials that form part of a carefully organized system that is highly structured, but is still flexible enough to adjust to local space constraints. </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-60">[60]</span>Each decorated initial assumes its place in the hierarchy with reference to two factors: its height, expressed by an equivalent number of text lines, and the media used to execute it – polychrome painted decoration or penwork tracery. In both <strong>V</strong> and<strong> BU</strong> it is possible to define three hierarchical levels of decorated initial, which here will be described as Classes 1, 2, and 3. Before addressing those, however, let us pay attention to the smallest organisational decorative element – the paraph. These marks, executed alternately in red and blue ink, are used to mark the beginnings of chapter titles in tables of contents, for rubrics that announce the titles of chapters, for list items in running text or vertical listings, to mark the beginnings of new units of meaning (so roughly equivalent to the modern concept of paragraph separation), and to begin the underlay of musical examples. In the second chapter of the <em>Expositio manus</em>, Tinctoris lists the locations on the hand where notes are to be referenced. A paraph clarifies the beginning of each item in the list in both manuscripts. Note, however, how in <strong>V</strong>, fol. 3<sup>r</sup> (<a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure862" href="#Figure862">Figure 8.62</a><span id="Figure862" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-62.jpg" alt="Universitat de València, Biblioteca Històrica, MS 835 [olim 844], fol. 3r.

Source: Biblioteca Universitaria, Bologna.</span></span>) each list item is afforded a new line, resulting in greater clarity for the reader. In a sense, the paraphs are playing a greater role in articulating the structure of the theoretical text in <strong>V</strong>, but without doubt there is a successful attempt in<strong> BU</strong> to enhance the clarity of the text, and the paraphs still play an important part in that process. This is the first example of several where an enhanced clarity of articulation through mise-en-page has been achieved in<strong> BU</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-61">[61]</span>Class-3 decorated initials are generally 2-line, executed in red or blue ink with blue or red tracery.

They are also used to restart the main text following interruption by a diagram, to mark the beginnings of paratexts such as the two <em>elogia</em> in <strong>V</strong>, to mark the beginning of the underlay of musical examples, and occasionally to mark the beginning of rubrics before the beginning of works, whose text is marked by an initial of a higher class. The tracery is limited to describing the square surrounding the letter shape and features only very slight extension into the left margin.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-62">[62]</span>In chapter 2 of the <em>Liber de natura et proprietate tonorum</em>, the second treatise in each manuscript, Tinctoris again lists sequences of types of interval.

This frees the paraph to be used to demarcate units of meaning in the text within each music-theoretical example given.

They are used to denote the beginnings of chapters, and are therefore one hierarchical level down from Class-1 initials, which denote the beginnings of treatises and their subdivision into books. In each Class-2 initial, the letter shape is rendered in shell gold or blue ink, and ornamented with penwork tracery in, respectively, violet or red ink. The initials alternate between blue and gold lettering, with the appropriate secondary colour. A few Class-2 initials in <strong>V</strong> are rendered with a red letter-form and blue tracery; this does not occur in<strong> BU</strong>, where the distinction between Class 2 as blue or gold and Class 3 as red or blue is maintained.

However, while Class-1 initials in <strong>BU</strong> up to this point have been almost always 6-line, in the planning of this page there was clearly concern over the amount of material to be presented in such a busy layout with two musical examples, and hence a 5-line initial is used. There is evidence elsewhere in <strong>BU</strong> of musical examples causing layout problems that caused portions of the main text to require erasure and recompletion in an abbreviated format. Here, therefore, on fol. 68<sup>v</sup>, the decorator was left with only a five-line space for the initial, which this may have influenced his decision to use more elaborate marginal extensions at this point. It appears that in the decision-making process for the mise-en-page of these treatises there was a flexible balance between following rigidly hierarchical structures and being sensitive to the visual balance of the page in question. The large amount of textual rubric on fol. 68<sup>v</sup> of <strong>BU</strong> has been mirrored by the artist in his use of red in the middle of the initial ‘T’, and in both foliate vines at the head and foot of the page.</p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-66">[66]</span>The initials that begin the sixth and seventh treatises follow the expected pattern, as does the eighth, <em>De arte contrapuncti</em>, until in <strong>V</strong>, the beginning of chapter 1 is decorated with a Class-1 initial (fol. 80<sup>v</sup>, <a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure882" href="#Figure882">Figure 8.82</a><span id="Figure882" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-82.jpg" alt="Universitat de València, Biblioteca Històrica, MS 835 [olim 844], fol. 80v.

This is the only point in <strong>V</strong> – apart from one example in the first treatise, where it is unremarkable since it follows the frontispiece directly – where a Class-1 initial is used for any reason other than to denote the beginning of a treatise or a book. It would appear that special significance has been given to this work in <strong>V</strong>, but not in<strong> BU</strong>, where the work receives the standard Class-2 initial. If, as discussed above, <strong>V</strong> was produced in late 1477 or 1478, very soon after the completion of this very treatise on 11 October 1477 (a date obtainable from <span class="siglum">B-Br II 4147</span>),<a href="notes.html#footnote-112" id="footnote-ref-112">112</a> then the fact that opportunity was taken in the hierarchy of initial decoration to herald the beginning of the <em>Liber de arte contrapuncti,</em> whose recent completion may have occasioned the very production of the codex, would make a good deal of sense.</p>

Crispus must have made an uncharacteristic error in his planning, underestimating the amount of space that would be required for the final chapters of Book 2, and therefore leaving an indentation in the ruling in order to accommodate a six-line Class-1 initial at the bottom of fol. 156<sup>r</sup>., where he anticipated Book 3 would begin. Upon completing the text, however, Crispus realized that he still had chapters 6 and 7 of Book 2 to fit in, resulting this localized disjunction between the hierarchy of the text and its expression in the decorated initials. As expected, there is no such problem in<strong> BU</strong>, where a fully elaborated Class-1 initial marks the beginning of the final section of the manuscript book. </p>

From the initial, and into the left border, extends a vine featuring a blue flower with a yellow centre, two white flowers tipped with purple, eight round brown fruits, twenty-one bezants with golden centres and black bristles, in addition to several green leaves.

In each case, the upper vine decoration on the top of the letter form is centred on a green circular feature, and to the left is rendered in blue with white highlighting, terminating in a purple flourish, while to the right the same construction is executed first in green, then in blue. In both examples, the marginal vine-decoration extension begins at the vertical midpoint of the rectangular space of the letter decoration with a blue flower with three petals and a gold centre. The supporting green vines are highlighted in a lighter green and a yellow-gold shade, while the gold bezants with black bristles are very close in execution. The five-petal marginal purple and pink flowers with gold centres, above and below the decorated letter, are also a formal and gestural match if not identical in shade and highlighting. These similarities, allied with the rather less refined execution than Nardo of the generic decorational style by Felice, suggest strongly that the latter artist was responsible for the polychrome decorated initials in <strong>V</strong>. </p>

The codex <span class="siglum">F-Pn Smith-Lesouëf 14</span> (1486) was written by Crispus and has initials by Felice, but no frontispiece. </p>

The strategy of triangulating or tapering the text outline was very commonly adopted in order to fulfil the priority of ensuring that the text reached the bottom of the page, and here one might imagine the intention was to enable the presentation of the motet <em>Martine presul inclyte superis </em>on the succeeding single opening (<strong>BU</strong> fols. 153<sup>v</sup>–154<sup>r</sup>, <a data-toggle="collapse" class="figureReference" data-target="#Figure8119" href="#Figure8119">Figure 8.119</a><span id="Figure8119" class="figure collapse"><img class="d-block img-fluid figure-img" src="img/8-119.jpg" alt="Bologna, Biblioteca Universitaria, MS 2573, fols. 153v–154r.

The decision to colour one of the triangles red on <strong>BU</strong>, fol. 153<sup>r</sup> may have been formally to reflect the extensive rubricated text at the head of the facing page; otherwise the expectation would be a symmetrical alternation of blue and green. </p>

The evident ubiquity of style of the red, blue, and green pen-flourished initials in Crispus’s output, when considered in the light of perceptible differences in style of the miniaturists within the same corpus, seems to suggest that it was in fact the scribe himself who was responsible for the execution of these intricate decorational features. </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-74">[74]</span>In summary, the frontispiece of <strong>V</strong> was executed by Nardo Rapicano, and its polychrome decorated initials were painted by Matteo Felice. The painted decoration of<strong> BU</strong> was possibly also contributed by Felice, and if it was not, then it was certainly executed by an artist whose style owed much to his work. If this is the case, then it is probable that the artist responsible was someone who has not yet been able to be identified by reference to court payment records. On stylistic grounds, it is most likely that the pen-flourished decoration in both <strong>V</strong> and<strong> BU</strong> was executed by the scribe Venceslaus Crispus. Comparison of the <strong>V</strong> miniature and other decorational elements of both <strong>V</strong> and<strong> BU</strong> can certainly tell us much about the priorities of those who planned and produced them, particularly when made with a wide selection of contemporary Neapolitan manuscripts. Indeed, it is hoped that such analysis may allow the potential for new avenues of research into that wider corpus of manuscripts, of which many questions of iconographical meaning and structural articulation through decoration remain to be asked.</p><h3>Later History</h3><p><span class="para-no" id="para-75">[75]</span>After King Ferrante I’s death in 1494, King Charles VIII of France invaded Italy, initially facing little opposition, and taking Naples in 1495, only for his gains to be lost almost immediately through the actions of the League of Venice.

For example, the manuscripts of Aquinas are ordered as follows: ‘Signato Thome 1’ (<em>Quaestiones disputatae</em>, <span class="siglum">E-VAu 47</span>); ‘Signato Thome 2’ (<em>De regno ad regem Cypri</em>, <span class="siglum">E-VAu 840</span>); ‘Signato Thome 3’ (<em>Aurea expositio sancti Pauli apostoli ad Corinthios</em>, <span class="siglum">E-VAu 380</span>); ‘Signato Thome 4’ (<em>De regimine principium</em>, <span class="siglum">E-VAu 759</span>); ‘Signato Thome 5’ (<em>De ente et essentia</em>, <span class="siglum">E-VAu 847</span>). </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-88">[88]</span>The books in the 1527 inventory are organized as one might expect them to have been arranged in a library, hence the music books are numbered consecutively within it. This method of organisation was not, however, reflected in the manner in which the books were actually transported to Valencia. The <em>imballaturo</em>, which is referred to at the end of the description of <strong>V</strong>, relates to another document: a packing list for the consignment, which is now lost. We learn from the entry on <strong>V</strong> that it was included in part 3. The codex was therefore packed with 60 other books: 177, 208, 158, 18C, 254, 27, 33, 173, 137, 175, 4, 261, 118, 17, 169, 3, 3 (no. 4), 8, 168, 104, 111, 76, 135, 170, 129, 88, 43, 253, 50, 214, 80, 265, 241, 300, 302, 294, 181, 164, 42, 67, 235, 60, 54, 84, 100, 72, 144, 186, 297, 225, 98, 269, 40, 183, 86, 245, 73, 233, 153, and 221. </p>

Fernando himself was a singer and composer, described as ‘the beloved friend of music’ by the composer Matheo Flecha (<em>c</em>.1481–1553) in his autobiographical ensalada, <em>La viuda</em>, and celebrated in the <em>Missa Ferdinandus Dux Calabriae</em> by Jacquet de Mantua (1483–1559).<a href="notes.html#footnote-153" id="footnote-ref-153">153</a>  Fernando’s wife Germana is known to have been a patron of music in her own right, until her untimely death in 1536, and owned several musical instruments.<a href="notes.html#footnote-154" id="footnote-ref-154">154</a> In 1540, Fernando married Mencìa de Mendoza (1508–1554), daughter of Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar y Mendoza (1466–1523), Marquis of Cenete.

<p><span class="para-no" id="para-91">[91]</span>Germana de Foix was directly responsible for the foundation of the Hieronymite monastery of San Miguel de los Reyes in Valencia, to which <strong>V</strong> was bequeathed, along with 794 other books, on the death of Fernando of Aragon in 1550.<a href="notes.html#footnote-156" id="footnote-ref-156">156</a> Germana’s 1536 will specified that such a monastery ought to be established in order to serve as a mausoleum for Fernando and herself, along with their families.

The dedication of the monastery to St Michael the Archangel is linked to that of the Order of the Ermine, the knightly order founded by King Ferrante in 1465, of which Fernando was by now head.

<p><span class="para-no" id="para-92">[92]</span>The binding of <strong>V</strong>, along with those of various other manuscripts in the library’s collection, was restored by the University of Valencia in 1972.<a href="notes.html#footnote-159" id="footnote-ref-159">159</a> Despite this fact being reported in the secondary literature, there is little published information concerning the circumstances surrounding and reasons behind the restoration.<a href="notes.html#footnote-160" id="footnote-ref-160">160</a> At the Biblioteca Històrica in Valencia, I was able to obtain a copy of the unpublished typescript of a presentation made by Srta. D<sup>a</sup> María del Pilar Gómez Gómez [<em>sic</em>], Director of the library of the University of Valencia, to the bank Caja de Ahorres y Monte de Piedad de Valencia, on 22 February 1971, that is essentially a funding application for the restoration works, and that includes details of the condition of the manuscripts at that time. It is entitled ‘Restauración y encuadernación de los códices existentes en la Biblioteca de la Universidad’.<a href="notes.html#footnote-161" id="footnote-ref-161">161</a> The document reveals that the fifteenth-century manuscripts held by the library were in such a poor state of conservation that they would not survive more than a few more years, due to the efforts of moths and other book-eating insects that favour Valencia’s climate. These pests had been eating the cardboard cartons in which the books were kept, the wooden boards of the bindings, and the books’ stitching, resulting in the fact that the spines of the majority of the manuscripts had been destroyed, which fate looks to have befallen <strong>V</strong>, since there is not obviously any original material left on the spine as part of the restored binding. The original leather bindings had either disintegrated or had become detached from the books they were intended to protect, and the quires had become unstitched and separated from one another. Fortunately, however, the infestation had not yet affected the main parchment body of the manuscripts. Two bookbinding restorers, Ramón Chuliá and Miguel Aguilar, had been commissioned to make exemplary restorations of a few (unspecified) codices. Since their example restorations were of similar quality, but Aguilar’s fees were lower, the latter was nominated for the contract. Aguilar was trained in the latest conservation techniques, and to apply chemical treatment to the books in order to prevent further outbreaks of insect-bibliophagy. Most regrettably of all, no photographs were taken by the restorers of<strong> V</strong> before or during its restoration.<a href="notes.html#footnote-162" id="footnote-ref-162">162</a></p><h3>Summary</h3><p><span class="para-no" id="para-93">[93]</span><strong>V</strong> may be understood with good reason to have been commissioned between the last few months of 1476 and the first few of 1477 by Giovanni of Aragon and completed between the last few months of 1477 and the first few of 1478. New physical analysis described herein of the manuscript supports the observations that led Woodley to his conclusions. Documentary records relating to the speed of production of manuscripts by the scribe of <strong>V</strong>, Venceslaus Crispus and his colleagues are also consistent with Woodley’s proposition. </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-94">[94]</span>However, it has been demonstrated above that two main aspects of the decoration are not entirely consistent with such an understanding. First, the Aragonese royal arms on the frontispieces of all the extant manuscripts that still feature Giovanni’s grey prothonotary’s hat are borne on a half-rounded escutcheon. <strong>V</strong> has a horse-head escutcheon, which is otherwise first seen in Giovanni’s dated or datable manuscripts in 1483. The horse-head escutcheon is, however, found in manuscripts that can be shown to have been prepared for King Ferrante from <em>c</em>.1467 and Alfonso, Duke of Calabria from 1472. Second, the golden bands that fall around the escutcheon are not otherwise found in conjunction with the prothonotary’s hat. These new observations, however, do not disprove Woodley’s theory. Unless further research can convincingly demonstrate that the shape of the escutcheon has incontrovertibly relevant significance, rather than having some other implication or being an expression of decorative custom or artistic whim, Woodley’s conclusions must stand. Further approaches to the study of heraldic decorative strategy in manuscripts prepared for the Aragonese royal family in late fifteenth-century may profitably include wholesale detailed analysis of surviving documentary records and the use of spectrography and other techniques of physical analysis in order to create more data.  </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-95">[95]</span>It has been demonstrated through in-depth study of, and comparison with other manuscripts written and decorated at Naples that the frontispiece of <strong>V</strong> may be considered the work of the artist Nardo Rapicano, while his colleague Matteo Felice was responsible for the secondary decoration. These two artists have been shown otherwise to have been working together with the scribe Venceslaus Crispus in the early 1480s, which observation is also inconsistent with the earlier dating of <strong>V</strong>. The portrait miniature may reasonably be considered a true likeness of Tinctoris, as first indicated (‘con lo imagine de lo auctore’) in the 1527 inventory of goods sent from Ferrara to Viceroy Fernando in Valencia. The decoration of initials running through the text are organized in a hierarchy that delineates the formal structure of Tinctoris’s music-theoretical texts, suggesting a high degree of understanding of the textual content by the scribe and artists, and collaborative planning potentially including Tinctoris himself. There are occasional infelicities in the execution of this decorative hierarchy that are not found in <strong>BU</strong>, a later copy of the same treatises. Indeed, there is perceptible refinement and extension of the decorative organizational strategy in the later manuscript.   </p>
<p><span class="para-no" id="para-95">[95]</span>The above exploration of the fifteenth-century production of<strong> V</strong>, followed by its sixteenth-century and later history provides evidence of the significant value of <strong>V</strong> to the Aragonese royal dynasty. Following its commissioning probably by Giovanni of Aragon, its production was entrusted to Venceslaus Crispus, one of the foremost scribes in Naples, and to the prominent artists Nardo Rapicano and Matteo Felice. They created a presentation manuscript of music theory that is headed by a portrait miniature of the author, accompanied by the Aragonese royal arms, whose organizational structure is made manifest in a rich hierarchy of decorated initials. These production values align well with our understanding of Tinctoris’s prominent position at the royal court to emphasize the importance of music as a cultural commodity at Naples in the late fifteenth century. That the manuscript was preserved through the political turmoil of the final few years of that century and the first few of the next, eventually to find its place in the newly established vice-royal court of Fernando and Germana at Valencia in the second quarter of the sixteenth century further underlines the cultural value attached to the manuscript and its contents. Indeed, at Valencia, ‘one of the most important centres for the arts and scholarly activity in Spain’,<a href="notes.html#footnote-163" id="footnote-ref-163">163</a> <strong>V</strong> can be seen at the heart of a newly expanded collection of music books within a flourishing centre of musical culture and practice. It is, therefore, no surprise that in modern times <strong>V</strong> should have become the subject of serious study not only as probably the earliest textual source for the main corpus of Tinctoris’s pedagogical treatises, but also as an opulent material artefact that continues to articulate and amplify the cultural values held by those who were responsible for its creation and preservation.</p>
