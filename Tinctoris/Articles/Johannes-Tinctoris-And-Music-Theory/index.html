				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>This online edited collection of essays and studies
				consists primarily of significantly expanded, revised and
				enriched versions of papers originally read at the conference
				‘Johannes Tinctoris and Music Theory in the Late Middle Ages
				and Early Renaissance’, 9–10 October 2014, in the Chancellor’s
				Hall, Senate House, University of London. This conference was
				organized by the editors as part of the AHRC-funded research
				project ‘The Complete Theoretical Works of Johannes Tinctoris:
				A New Digital Edition’ (2011–14), and was supported by Royal
				Birmingham Conservatoire in collaboration with the Institute
				of Musical Research. The collection includes additional
				contributions that do not derive from papers read at the
				conference and which are provided to enhance coverage of
				Tinctoris’s biography and the history of the principal
					manuscript sources of his theoretical works.</p>
				<h3>Part One: Reading Tinctoris</h3>
				<h4>1. Jeffrey J. Dean, ‘<a href="Dean/">Tinctoris’s Reading Practice: De inventione et usu musice and his Greek Authorities</a>’</h4>
				<p class="abstract">Johannes Tinctoris famously cited actual
				musical works in order to interrogate them as witnesses of
				compositional and notational practice. But his citations of
				literary works were less critical; he treated them as
				authorities, to be invoked, not questioned. There was a major
				qualitative change in the range of works he drew upon, which
				coincided with the final phase of his work on <i>De arte
				contrapuncti</i> (completed 11 October 1477). He began to cite
				many more ancient writings, especially Greek ones. He nearly
				always quoted exactly enough to identify precisely which
				printed Latin translations of Greek writings he used. His use
				of Eusebius’ <i>Praeparatio evangelica</i> (Venice: Nicolaus
				Jenson, 1470) proves that the manuscript excerpts of his <i>De
				inventione et usu musice</i> cannot have been written earlier,
				and must be coeval with the printed excerpts of 1482×3. He did
				not employ the humanistic periodization of history into
				antiquity, the middle ages, and rebirth, but articulated
				history sociologically in a characteristically medieval
				fashion.</p>
				<h4>2. Stefano Mengozzi, ‘<a href="Mengozzi/">Dahlhaus’s Principles
				and Tinctoris’s Ears: Music Theory as Rhetoric</a>’</h4>
				<p class="abstract">We may read the music theory of the past
				ontologically, i.e. as the factual articulation of the musical
				principles that actively inform a given musical culture, or
				rhetorically, i.e. as delivering forms of musical knowledge
				rooted in creative intuition, and subject to linguistic
				conventions and disciplinary interests shared by changing
				communities of readers. By the former method – arguably
				adopted in Carl Dahlhaus’s <i>Studies on the Origins of Harmonic
						Tonality</i> – the history of music theory is the history of
					musical ontologies that are <i>ipso facto</i> ushered into being by
				the emergence of new concepts and labels. By the latter, it is
				the history of culturally contingent and experience-based
				conceptualizations of musical patterns, objects, and choices
				understood as preter-linguistic and trans-historical. Such
				alternative approaches to language may be a function of
				authors as much as readers: Johannes Tinctoris at times
				appears to ascribe ontological weight to language; elsewhere,
				however, he wields it rhetorically, as a means of persuading
				his readers of the soundness of his musical judgments –
				offering new music-theoretical insights along the way.</p>
				<h4>3. Adam Whittaker, ‘<a href="#">Reading Tinctoris’s Readers:
				Hints at Musical Reading Practices in Johannes Tinctoris’s
				Notational Treatises</a>’</h4>
				<p class="abstract">Tinctoris’s theories and comments on
				fifteenth-century musical practice are well known to scholars
				of medieval and renaissance music theory. His characteristic
				zeal for theoretical precision in some respects and his
				exhaustive treatment of notational topics render him at once
				one of the most devoted admirers and most outspoken critics of
				fifteenth-century compositional practice. Despite the
				scholarly interest in Tinctoris’s theoretical works and some
				detailed study of the surviving manuscript sources,
				understanding the likely readerships for his treatises has
				proved more elusive. This chapter considers the extent to
				which clues left in Tinctoris’s texts and musical examples can
				help us to better understand the readerships for – and reading
				modalities associated with – such texts. It examines a range
				of different examples from Tinctoris’s texts, and considers
				these through the lens of the famous frontispiece to the
				Valencia codex depicting Tinctoris at work as a musical
				reader, raising key questions around the practices of musical
				reading in the late fifteenth century.</p>
				<h3>Part Two: Modal and Contrapuntal Theory</h3>
				<h4>4. Alexander Morgan, ‘<a href="#">The Tacit Principles of
				Tinctoris’s Interval Successions</a>’</h4>
				<p class="abstract">Medieval and renaissance counterpoint
				treatises offer a practical guide to composing and improvising
				polyphony that respects stylistic norms. These counterpoint
				treatises are also replete with theoretical implications and
				can serve as a penetrating window into renaissance musical
				thought, training, and style. Sarah Fuller has described
				Tinctoris’s <i>Liber de arte contrapuncti</i> as a
				‘culmination of contrapunctus theory from the preceding two
				centuries’, underlining its importance to our understanding of
				the period. In this chapter I re-examine <i>De arte
				contrapuncti</i> in order to rectify the common misconception
				that its interval-succession list is exhaustive, and to reveal
				nine tacit contrapuntal principles that Tinctoris
				systematically followed in the examples in the treatise. In
				addition to providing insight into Tinctoris’s intervallic
				thinking, my methodology also serves as a general model for
				taking a corpus-study approach in researching the examples in
				counterpoint treatises in order to enrich our understanding of
				them.</p>
