# About JT:CPW

_Johannes Tinctoris: Complete Practical Works_ (_JT:CPW_) is a digital critical edition, in the original mensural notation, of the compositions of the fifteenth-century music theorist Johannes Tinctoris (c.1435–1511). Presented here are all Tinctoris’s practical compositions, including those composed as examples in the treatise [De arte contrapuncti](https://earlymusictheory.org/Tinctoris/texts/deartecontrapuncti/). Also included are selected works of Guillaume du Faÿ and Antoine Busnoys, which were edited by the project team as test material for [MeRIT](https://interpreter.earlymusictheory.org/), the Mensural Rhythm Interpretation Tool, our software that automatically interprets imperfection and alteration.

Where the music we have edited exists in multiple sources, we have presented our preferred readings in the default view. We have also encoded all variants, which may be consulted using the ‘show/hide variants’ button at the far right of the top menu bar. When ‘show variants’ is selected, content with multiple readings appears in green. On selecting the green mensural notation or text, the variant readings will appear within yellow pop-up boxes.
