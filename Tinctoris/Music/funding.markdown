# Funding acknowledgements

The project team gratefully acknowledges funding from a research grant awarded in 2017 by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) [grant number AH/P013910/1].

Statement from the AHRC website:

The AHRC funds world-class, independent researchers in a wide range of subjects: history, archaeology, digital content, philosophy, languages, design, heritage, area studies, the creative and performing arts, and much more. The quality and range of research supported by the AHRC’s investment of public funds not only provides social and cultural benefits and contributes to the economic success of the UK but also to the culture and welfare of societies around the globe.
