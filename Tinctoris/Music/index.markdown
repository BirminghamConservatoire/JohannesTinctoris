{% include cpw_header.html %}

In progress here is a critical edition, in the original notation, of all Tinctoris’s practical compositions, including those composed as illustrations in [De arte contrapuncti](../texts/deartecontrapuncti/). We have also edited selected works Guillaume du Faÿ and Antoine Busnoys as test material for our software tool that automatically interprets imperfection and alteration.
