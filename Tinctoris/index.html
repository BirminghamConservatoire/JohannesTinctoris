		  <p>JOHANNES TINCTORIS (<em>c</em>. 1435â€“1511) is widely acknowledged as one of the most important writers on music of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance. His twelve Latin treatises demonstrate not only an exceptional technical command of the intellectually demanding musical notation and theory of the time, but also an intimate acquaintance with contemporary compositional practice, derived from a close knowledge of the composers of his day and their music, both in northern Europe, where he began his career, and in Italy, where he was employed from the 1470s to the early 1490s at the Aragonese royal court in Naples.</p>
  		<p>The Tinctoris site
