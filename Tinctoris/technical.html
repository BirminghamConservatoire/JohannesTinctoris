We strive to ensure that these pages conform to web standards, but
these standards are dynamic, and are not always quickly and
consistently adopted by browser developers. 

We test our pages on the latest versions Webkit and Gecko-based
browsers (e.g. Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari and Google Chrome) on Mac
OS 10.7+. Other browsers and platforms may not display aspects of the
site as we intended. 

We are <a href="mailto:d.lewis@gold.ac.uk">keen to hear</a> about any technical issues that do arise.
