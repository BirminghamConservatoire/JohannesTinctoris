      <h3 id="#SourceTranscription">Source transcriptions</h3>

    <p>These are not intended to be diplomatic transcriptions. Users
    who require exact details should consult the facsimiles of the
    original sources. Wherever possible these are included on this web
    site; otherwise there are links to other host sites. 
    We have attempted to transcribe all details contributing to an
    understanding of the text in its source, including the size and
    colour of decorative initials, the use of red ink, etc. [Note (16 
    December 2020): We have not yet incorporated the source transcriptions 
    and facsimiles for Books II–III of <i>De arte contrapuncti</i>. We hope to 
    add them in the course of 2021.]</p>
    <p>All abbreviations in the sources are expanded in the
    transcriptions. There is only a single category for which there is
    any ambiguity: where the supraliteral bar or tittle (e.g. ā)
    indicates a single nasal consonant that the spelling conventions
    of the time allowed to be <i>m</i> or <i>n</i> equally, as for
    example in
      <i>eamdem</i>/<i>eandem</i> or <i>namque</i>/<i>nanque</i>. In
    such cases the tittle has been realized according to the
    alternative prevalent in the particular source for the particular
    word when spelt out in full. The ampersand & and its equivalent,
      the Tironian <i>et</i> sign (similar to the modern figure 7), are spelt
    out as ‘et’ except in the compendium &c., which represents a
    symbol used in musical quotations (see the facsimiles).</p>

    <p>Capitalization and punctuation follow the source as closely as
    possible. In some cases this is not exact. For example, the
    vertical position of points is not always easily represented in
    type; one of the principal sources (<b>Br1</b>) often uses a
    majuscule <i>I</i> in cases where no intention of capitalization
    or emphasis is evident (this scribe normally indicated real
    capitals with a red highlight stroke, which has been
    transcribed). The manuscripts in cursive script (<b>Br1</b>
    and <b>G</b>) use the virgula (<sub class="virgula"> ∕ <!-- ⁄ //
    --></sub>) as their chief punctuation mark (the corrector of the
    Crispus manuscripts <b>V</b> and <b>BU</b> also does so from time
    to time); the present-day solidus (/) being excessively large, the
    virgula is transcribed as a comma (,). Space fillers (occasionally
    found at the ends of manuscript lines) and decorative points are
    transcribed with a visual approximation.</p>

    <p>Both the Valencia and Bologna copies (<b>V</b> and <b>BU</b>)
    of Tinctoris’s collected writings, written by Venceslaus Crispus,
    were corrected by someone concerned with the minutiae of his
    orthography, probably the notator of the music examples (but not
    Tinctoris himself). <b>V</b> is less heavily corrected in general
    than <b>BU</b>. The three principal categories of intervention
    are, first, a fine vertical hairline separating two words that had
    been written without a space between them; second, a horizontal
    extension of part of the letter before a space to join it to the
    following word; third, conversion of <i>m</i> to <i>n</i> by
    expunging (writing a little dot beneath) the last stroke of the
    letter. The corrector also seems to have added and deleted
    punctuation marks (though it is more difficult to be certain this
    was the same person). We have incorporated these corrections into
    the transcriptions of <b>V</b> and <b>BU</b> with the
    symbols <span class="wordsplit">|</span>, <span class="wordjoin">_</span>,
    <span class="correction"><span class="overwritten
    m">m</span><span class="correct n">n</span></span>,
    <span class="correction insertedPunctuation">.</span> and
    <span class="correction removedPunctuation">.</span>  respectively
    (and so for other punctuation marks). The corrector’s expunction of
    whole letters, words, or other portions of text are likewise shown
    in grey; other scribes’ cancellation by striking through letters
    or words will be self-evident.</p>


    <p>All other corrections, alterations, and annotations – whether
    by a contemporary or by someone much later – are described in
    notes, indicated in the transcription by an asterisk (*), as are
    other details of substance or layout not easily transcribed
    (especially in music examples); the note will appear in a small
    pop-up window when the cursor hovers over an asterisk. Line breaks
    in the verbal text are not followed in the transcription (but they
    are noted when they give rise to errors); staff breaks in music
    examples are transcribed, as the number of staff lines or the
    position of a clef often changes from staff to staff and may help
    to account for a particular variant.</p>

    <h3 id="Edition">Edition</h3>

    <p>The usage of the sources has been followed with respect to the
      representation of the classical diphthong <i>ae</i>: this was
      adopted by the printer of Tinctoris’s <i>Diffinitorium</i>, but
      all other scribes and printers used the medieval <i>e</i>, which
      sometimes creates a grammatical ambiguity that we do not wish to
      disguise. We have attempted to discern the spelling of
      Tinctoris’ own manuscript and to reflect this in the edition,
      rather than to normalize to any standard other than the
      author’s; in some cases this results in the edition presenting a
      word with a spelling found in none of the sources. All variant
      spellings are recorded in the critical apparatus. On the other
      hand, we have not reported variants of word division; the
      sometimes capricious practice of scribes (and the corrector) can
      be seen in the source transcriptions and facsimiles.</p>

    <p>Two alternative styles of punctuation and capitalization are
      available. The ‘Manuscript punctuation’ mode (which must be
      deliberately selected) is based on the usage of the sources
      (including printed ones when pertinent). The sources are
      distinctly in general agreement regarding capitalization, rather
      less so for punctuation; we have attempted to apply punctuation
      consistently in grammatically or rhetorically parallel
      passages. We have adopted the punctuation marks prevalent in the
      more formal manuscript sources and in the printed sources: point
      . , colon : , question mark ? , parentheses ( ) , and pilcrow ¶,
      omitting the decorative variants of the first two that can be
      seen in the source transcriptions and facsimiles. The point
      functions as the equivalent of the modern full stop or period,
      comma, and exclamation mark; the colon of the modern colon and
      semicolon (we have chosen to ignore the not infrequent
      manuscript use of the colon as an emphatic point, as this is
      unsystematic and tends to confuse more than it clarifies). The
      manuscripts in cursive script tend to use the virgula in the
      same ways as the point in the other sources; it is not clear
      when they do present a point that it is meant to signify
      anything else.</p>

    <p>We believe that ‘Manuscript punctuation’ accurately represents
    Tinctoris’ intended capitalization and closely approximates his
    punctuation, but it does not make for easy reading of the Latin
    text. The ‘Modern punctuation’ mode (presented by default, or it
    may be returned to after ‘Manuscript punctuation’ has previously
    been selected) improves readability by punctuating according to
    modern principles of grammar and logic (rather than the more
    oratorical principles followed in the sources) and using all
    common present-day punctuation marks. In some cases modern
    punctuation alters sentence structures and consequent
    capitalization, and even introduces paragraph breaks. Because they
    are not the same in the two punctuation modes, variants of
    capitalization and punctuation are not recorded in the critical
    apparatus (which would also seem overburdened if they were); the
    usage of particular sources must be sought in the transcriptions
    and facsimiles.</p>

    <p>The distinction between ‘modern’ and ‘manuscript’ punctuation
    also facilitates one peculiarity of Tinctoris’s orthography. He
    was evidently in the habit of writing the enclitic ‘‑que’ (meaning
    ‘and’) as a separate word rather than as a suffix attached to the
    preceding word as is normal Latin orthography now. As this has
    dangerous potential for confusing inexpert Latin readers, the
    ‘Modern punctuation’ mode displays ‘‑que’ close up to the
    preceding word as usual, whereas ‘Manuscript punctuation’ displays
    ‘que’ separately according to Tinctoris’s usage.</p>

    <p>The default viewing mode is to ‘Hide variants’ in order to
    encourage continuous reading of the Latin text. When ‘Show
    variants’ is selected, loci of variation are indicated by green
    text or notational elements (note that two or more loci of
    variation may be immediately adjacent), variants of insertion by a
    caret (<!-- ^ -->‸) below the line of verbal text or (inverted) above the
    staff of a music example; the apparatus will appear in a small
    pop-up window when the cursor hovers over a locus of
    variation.</p>

    <h3 id="Translation">Translation</h3>

    <p>The principal aim in the English translation has been
    accuracy. We have tried to make it readily intelligible, but we
    have also tried to resist the temptation to clarify what Tinctoris
    left less than clear in his Latin. This function – valuable in its
    own right – is separated into the interpretative materials that
    will eventually form part of this web site, while the translation,
    if it succeeds, will allow researchers who may not be able to read
    Latin to argue about his meaning as well as if they could.</p>

    <p>The bulk of Tinctoris’s treatises consists of technical matter,
    expressed very plainly; for the most part, Tinctoris aimed for
    eloquence only in the Prologues and Conclusions to his
    writings. In these contexts we have tried to emulate his
    straightforward elegance without compromising precision of
    translation. In the technical portions of the writing, we have
    attempted consistently to render a particular Latin term by the
    same English equivalent; Tinctoris was frequently repetitive to
    the point of obsessiveness when saying things that vary only in
    detail. We have chosen to render Tinctoris’ technical terms on the
    whole by words that are as close to his own as possible: for
    instance, Tinctoris used ‘augmentation’ to mean the increase in
    the length of a note effected by a dot and ‘diminution’ to mean
    the elaboration of a simple melodic outline into a more complex
    one or of note-against-note into florid counterpoint, not in the
    more familiar sense to mean the substitution of notes of the next
    greater or smaller rhythmic value, and therefore we do not use
    these words in the latter sense either.</p>
