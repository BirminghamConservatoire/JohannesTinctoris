      <h2>A note about treatise titles</h2>
      <p>The Brussels copy (<b>Br1</b>) of Tinctoris’s collected
      writings differs from the two copies made by the scribe
      Venceslaus Crispus (<b>V</b>, <b>BU</b>) in giving much more
      prolix versions of the titles of treatises, regularly including
      details about the author and irregular in form (designation as
        <i>liber</i>/<i>tractatus</i>/<i>scriptum</i>/nothing;
        construction with genitive or <i>de</i> + ablative; position of the
      author’s name and qualifications within or after the title
      proper); two treatises also bear detailed colophons at the end
      in <b>Br1</b>. These variants must be authentic: it would be
      silly to suppose that a scribe might have made them up, and the
      character of the Brussels titles is mirrored in the title of the
      printed source of <i>De inventione et usu musice</i> (<b>R</b>),
      whose compositor was working from copy provided by
      Tinctoris. (All other sources are remote from the author.)</p>

      <p>However, Tinctoris almost certainly oversaw the production of
        Crispus’s copies, so there is authority also for the shorter
        and more normalized versions of treatise titles in these
        sources, especially in their tables of contents; his
        occasional self-citations also employ such. Although these
        brief titles may represent Tinctoris’s mature decision, there
        is real value in the prolix titles of <b>Br1</b>, and we have
        given these at the head of the critical editions of the
        treatises (and the colophons at the end, when they exist). The
        brief titles, nevertheless, are far more convenient for
        purposes of reference; the philologically ‘true’ title may
        be <i>The tragicall historie of Hamlet prince of Denmarke</i>,
        but we know the play as
        <i>Hamlet</i>. We therefore give brief titles (as listed below) in
        the header bars of the texts and in the Text menu, and we hope
        that these will become the conventional titles used for
        reference and citation.</p>

      <p>In the same spirit, we offer the following conventional abbreviations for use as appropriate:</p>
      <table class="abbreviationsAndExpansions">
        <tr><td class="abbr">Exp. manus</td><td class="expansion">Expositio manus</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="abbr">De ton.</td><td class="expansion">De natura et proprietate tonorum</td></tr>
