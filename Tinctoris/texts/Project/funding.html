      <h2>Funding acknowledgements</h2> 
      <p>The project team acknowledges with gratitude funding from a
      Research Grant awarded in 2011 by the Arts and Humanities
      Research Council (AHRC). This strand of the Tinctoris project
      runs until 30 June 2014.</p>

      <p>Statement from the AHRC website:</p>

      <p>‘The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funds
        world-class, independent researchers in a wide range of
        subjects: ancient history, modern dance, archaeology, digital
        content, philosophy, English literature, design, the creative
        and performing arts, and much more.  This financial year the
        AHRC will spend approximately £98m to fund research and
        postgraduate training in collaboration with a number of
        partners. The quality and range of research supported by this
        investment of public funds not only provides social and
        cultural benefits but also contributes to the economic success
        of the UK. For further information on the AHRC, please go to:
