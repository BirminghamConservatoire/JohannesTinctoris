		  <p>JOHANNES TINCTORIS (<em>c</em>. 1435â€“1511) is widely acknowledged as one of the most important writers on music of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance. His twelve Latin treatises demonstrate not only an exceptional technical command of the intellectually demanding musical notation and theory of the time, but also an intimate acquaintance with contemporary compositional practice, derived from a close knowledge of the composers of his day and their music, both in northern Europe, where he began his career, and in Italy, where he was employed from the 1470s to the early 1490s at the Aragonese royal court in Naples.</p>
  		<p>This project, currently in its initial stages of development, presents a complete new edition of Tinctoris's treatises, along with full English translations and multiple layers of commentary material, covering a wide range of technical, historical and critical issues arising from both the texts themselves and the wider context of Tinctoris&rsquo;s life and the musical environment of early Renaissance Europe. Combining the highest levels of historical, textual and critical scholarship with innovative technological presentation, this open-access edition  explores new methods of relating text-based materials to the numerous, often complex, music examples that punctuate the treatises.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.stoa.org/tinctoris/">legacy version
      of the Tinctoris project</a>, hosted by The Stoa Consortium, is
      still available, but in due course it will be subsumed
      completely within the new site.</p>  <hr />
