  <h1>Early Music Theory</h1>
  <p>The Early Music Theory website has been set up as an evolving
  scholarly resource dedicated to a variety of issues relating to
  the notation and intellectual context of music in the medieval
  and early modern period, as well as to the inter-relationships
  beween these issues and musical performance and composition.</p>
  <p>We hope that this open-access resource will gradually become
  an online focus for a wide range of high-quality material
  relevant to musicologists, historians and performing musicians
  with a serious interest in such areas of study. If you are
  involved, either as an academic researcher or musical
  practitioner, in areas of early music that impinge especially on
  theory and notation, or their wider historical, compositional or
  performance contexts, and you wish to propose material for
  inclusion on this site, please feel free
    to <a href="mailto:ronald.woodley@bcu.ac.uk">contact us</a>.</p>

    <p>The first theorist to inhabit this space is the
      fifteenth-century musician and lawyer Johannes Tinctoris
      (<i>c.</i> 1435-1511), whose life and works have been the
      subject of the ongoing research of the site’s founding editor,
      Ronald Woodley. A new edition of Tinctoris’s complete
      theoretical writings is being constructed here, resulting from a
      project funded by the Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council UK
      and developed by a research team from Birmingham Conservatoire
      (Ronald Woodley, Jeffrey Dean and David Lewis).</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.stoa.org/tinctoris/">legacy version
        of the Tinctoris project</a>, hosted by The Stoa Consortium, is still
      available, but in due course it will be subsumed completely within
      the new site.</p>
