  <h1>Early Music Theory</h1>
  <p>The Early Music Theory website was founded by Ronald Woodley in 2013 as an evolving
		  scholarly resource dedicated to a variety of issues relating to
		  the notation and intellectual context of music in the medieval
		  and early modern period, as well as to the inter-relationships
		  between these issues and musical performance and composition.</p>
      <p>This open-access resource is intended to be
      an online focus for a wide range of high-quality material
      relevant to musicologists, historians and performing musicians
      with a serious interest in such areas of study. If you are
      involved, either as an academic researcher or musical
      practitioner, in areas of early music that impinge especially on
      theory and notation, or their wider historical, compositional or
      performance contexts, and you wish to propose material for
      inclusion on this site, please feel free
				to <a href="mailto:ronald.woodley@bcu.ac.uk">contact us</a>.</p>

					Ronald Woodley.</p>
